======================================================================

[00:00] - This is a video about
one of the most important,
[00:02] yet least understood
concepts in all of physics.
[00:07] It governs everything
from molecular collisions
[00:09] to humongous storms.
[00:12] From the beginning of the universe
[00:14] through its entire evolution,
to its inevitable end.
[00:19] It may, in fact, determine
the direction of time
[00:22] and even be the reason that life exists.
[00:25] To see the confusion around this topic,
[00:27] you need to ask only one simple question.
[00:31] What does the Earth get from the sun?
[00:35] - What does the earth get from sun?
[00:39] - Well, it's light rays?
[00:41] - What do we get from the sun?
- Heat.
[00:43] - Warmth.
[00:43] - Warmth, light.
[00:45] - Vitamin D, we get vitamin D from-
[00:47] - We do get vitamin D
from the ultraviolet rays.
[00:49] - Well, a lot of energy.
[00:51] - What does the earth
get from this, energy?
[00:53] - Yeah, energy.
[00:54] - Energy.
[00:56] - Nailed it.
[00:57] Every day, the earth gets
a certain amount of energy
[00:59] from the sun.
[01:00] And then how much energy
does the earth radiate back
[01:04] into space relative to that amount
[01:06] that it gets from the sun?
[01:07] - Probably not as much, I, you know,
[01:09] I don't believe it's just
radiating right back.
[01:12] - I'd say less.
[01:14] - Less.
[01:14] - Less.
- I say less.
[01:16] - I guess about 70%?
[01:17] - It is a fraction.
[01:18] - I'd say 20%.
[01:19] - Because...
- Because we use some of it.
[01:22] - We use some of the energy.
- Mm-hmm.
[01:23] - We consume a lot, right?
[01:24] - But the thing about energy
is it never really goes away.
[01:28] You can't really use it up.
[01:30] - It would have to
break even, wouldn't it?
[01:32] Same amount, yeah.
[01:33] - You know, cause and effect.
[01:35] It'd be equal in some ways, right?
[01:37] - For most of the earth's history,
[01:39] it should be exactly the
same amount of energy
[01:41] in from the sun as earth
radiates into space.
[01:45] - Wow.
[01:46] - Because if we didn't do that,
[01:48] then the earth would get a lot
hotter, that'd be a problem.
[01:50] - That'd be a big problem.
[01:51] - So, if that is the case...
[01:53] - Yeah.
[01:54] - Then what are we really
getting from the sun?
[01:57] - That's a good question.
[01:58] - Hmm.
[01:59] - It gives us a nice tan.
[02:01] - It gives us a nice tan, I love it.
[02:03] We're getting something
special from the sun.
[02:05] - I don't know, what do
we get without the energy?
[02:07] - But nobody talks about it.
[02:09] To answer that, we have
to go back to a discovery
[02:12] made two centuries ago.
[02:15] In the winter of 1813,
France was being invaded
[02:18] by the armies of Austria,
Prussia, and Russia.
[02:22] The son of one of Napoleon's generals
[02:24] was Sadi Carnot, a 17-year-old student.
[02:27] On December 29th, he
writes a letter to Napoleon
[02:30] to request to join in the fight.
[02:32] Napoleon preoccupied in
battle, never replies.
[02:36] but Carnot gets his
wish a few months later
[02:39] when Paris is attacked.
[02:41] The students defend a chateau
just east of the city,
[02:44] but there're no match
for the advancing armies,
[02:47] and Paris falls after
only a day of fighting.
[02:50] Forced to retreat, Carnot is devastated.
[02:56] Seven years later, he
goes to visit his father
[02:59] who's fled to Prussia
after Napoleon's downfall.
[03:02] His father was not only a
general, but also a physicist.
[03:06] He wrote an essay on how energy
[03:07] is most efficiently transferred
in mechanical systems.
[03:11] When his son comes to
visit, they talk at length
[03:14] about the big breakthrough
of the time, steam engines.
[03:18] Steam engines were already
being used to power ships,
[03:21] mine ore, and excavate ports.
[03:24] And it was clear that
the future industrial
[03:26] and military might of nations
[03:28] depended on having the best steam engines.
[03:33] But French designs were falling behind
[03:35] those of other countries like Britain.
[03:37] So, Sadi Carnot took it upon
himself to figure out why.
[03:45] At the time, even the best steam engines
[03:47] only converted around 3% of thermal energy
[03:50] into useful mechanical work.
[03:52] If he could improve on
that, he could give France
[03:55] a huge advantage and restore
its place in the world.
[03:59] So he spends the next three
years studying heat engines,
[04:03] and one of his key insights
[04:05] involves how an ideal
heat engine would work,
[04:08] one with no friction and no
losses to the environment.
[04:12] It looks something like this.
[04:16] Take two really big metal
bars, one hot and one cold.
[04:20] The engine consists of a
chamber filled with air,
[04:24] where heat can only flow in
or out through the bottom.
[04:28] Inside the chamber is a piston,
[04:30] which is connected to a flywheel.
[04:32] The air starts at a
temperature just below that
[04:35] of the hot bar.
[04:36] So first, the hot bar
is brought into contact
[04:38] with the chamber.
[04:39] The air inside expands
with heat flowing into it
[04:42] to maintain its temperature.
[04:44] This pushes the piston
up, turning the flywheel.
[04:48] Next, the hot bar is removed,
[04:50] but the air in the chamber
continues to expand,
[04:53] except now without heat entering,
the temperature decreases.
[04:57] In the ideal case,
[04:58] until it is the temperature
of the cold bar.
[05:01] The cold bar is brought into
contact with the chamber
[05:04] and the flywheel pushes the piston down.
[05:06] And as the air is compressed,
[05:08] heat is transferred into the cold bar.
[05:11] The cold bar is removed.
[05:12] The flywheel compresses the gas further
[05:15] increasing its temperature
until it is just below that
[05:17] of the hot bar.
[05:19] Then the hot bar is connected
again and the cycle repeats.
[05:23] Through this process, heat
from the hot bar is converted
[05:26] into the energy of the flywheel.
[05:30] And what's interesting to note
about Carnot's ideal engine
[05:33] is that it is completely reversible.
[05:35] If you ran the engine in reverse,
[05:38] first the air expands
lowering the temperature,
[05:41] then the chamber is brought
into contact with the cold bar,
[05:44] the air expands more, drawing
in heat from the cold bar.
[05:48] Next, the air is compressed,
increasing its temperature.
[05:52] The chamber is placed
on top of the hot bar
[05:54] and the energy of the flywheel
is used to return the heat
[05:58] back into the hot bar.
[06:00] However many cycles were run
in the forward direction,
[06:03] you could run the same number
in reverse, and at the end,
[06:07] everything would return
to its original state
[06:10] with no additional input
of energy required.
[06:14] So by running an ideal engine,
nothing really changes.
[06:17] You can always undo what you did.
[06:22] So what is the efficiency of this engine?
[06:25] Since it's fully reversible,
[06:26] you might expect the
efficiency to be 100%,
[06:30] but that is not the case.
[06:32] Each cycle, the energy
of the flywheel increases
[06:35] by the amount of heat flowing
[06:36] into the chamber from the hot bar,
[06:38] minus the heat flowing out of
the chamber at the cold bar.
[06:42] So to calculate the efficiency,
we divide this energy
[06:46] by the heat input from the hot bar.
[06:50] Now the heat in on the hot
side is equal to the work done
[06:53] by the gas on the piston,
[06:55] and this will always be
greater than the work done
[06:58] by the piston on the gas on the cold side,
[07:01] which equals the heat out.
[07:03] And this is because on the hot side,
[07:05] the hot gas exerts a greater pressure
[07:07] on the piston than that
same gas when cold.
[07:11] To increase the efficiency of the engine,
[07:13] you could increase the
temperature of the hot side,
[07:16] or decrease the temperature
of the cold side, or both.
[07:21] Lord Kelvin learns of
Carnot's ideal heat engine
[07:24] and realizes it could form the basis
[07:27] for an absolute temperature scale.
[07:30] Imagine that the gas is allowed
to expand an extreme amount,
[07:34] so much that it cools to the point
[07:36] where all the gas particles
effectively stop moving.
[07:39] Then they would exert no
pressure on the piston,
[07:42] and it would take no work to compress it
[07:44] on the cold side, so
no heat would be lost.
[07:48] This is the idea of absolute zero,
[07:52] and it would make for a
100% efficient engine.
[07:56] Using this absolute temperature
scale, the Kelvin scale,
[08:00] we can replace the
amount of heat in and out
[08:02] with the temperature of the
hot and cold side respectively,
[08:06] because they are directly proportional.
[08:09] So we can express efficiency like this,
[08:11] which we can rewrite like this.
[08:15] What we have learned
is that the efficiency
[08:17] of an ideal heat engine
doesn't depend on the materials
[08:20] or the design of the engine,
[08:21] but fundamentally on the temperatures
[08:23] of the hot and cold sides.
[08:26] To reach 100% efficiency,
you'd need infinite temperature
[08:29] on the hot side or absolute
zero on the cold side,
[08:32] both of which are impossible in practice.
[08:35] So even with no friction or
losses to the environment,
[08:37] it's impossible to make a
heat engine 100% efficient.
[08:41] And that's because to return the piston
[08:43] to its original position,
[08:44] you need to dump heat into the cold bar.
[08:47] So not all the energy
stays in the flywheel.
[08:51] Now, in Carnot's time,
high pressure steam engines
[08:54] could only reach temperatures
up to 160 degrees Celsius.
[08:57] So their theoretical
maximum efficiency was 32%,
[09:02] but their real efficiency
was more like 3%.
[09:05] That's because real engines
experience friction,
[09:08] dissipate heat to the environment,
[09:10] and they don't transfer heat
at constant temperatures.
[09:13] So for just as much heat going in,
[09:15] less energy ends up in the flywheel.
[09:18] The rest is spread out over
the walls of the cylinder,
[09:21] the axle of the flywheel,
[09:23] and is radiated out into the environment.
[09:26] When energy spreads out like this,
[09:29] it is impossible to get it back.
[09:31] So this process is irreversible.
[09:34] The total amount of energy didn't change,
[09:37] but it became less usable.
[09:39] Energy is most usable
when it is concentrated
[09:43] and less usable when it's spread out.
[09:48] Decades later, German
physicist, Rudolf Clausius,
[09:51] studies Carnot's engine,
and he comes up with a way
[09:54] to measure how spread out the energy is.
[09:58] He calls this quantity, entropy.
[10:02] When all the energy is
concentrated in the hot bar,
[10:05] that is low entropy,
[10:07] but as the energy spreads
to the surroundings,
[10:10] the walls of the chamber and the axle
[10:12] will entropy increases.
[10:15] This means the same amount
of energy is present,
[10:17] but in this more dispersed form,
[10:19] it is less available to do work.
[10:23] In 1865, Clausius summarizes
the first two laws
[10:27] of thermodynamics like this.
[10:29] First, the energy of the
universe is constant.
[10:33] And second, the entropy of the
universe tends to a maximum.
[10:38] In other words, energy
spreads out over time.
[10:44] The second law is core to so
many phenomena in the world.
[10:48] It's why hot things cool
down and cool things heat up,
[10:51] why gas expands to fill a container,
[10:54] why you can't have a
perpetual motion machine,
[10:57] because the amount of usable
energy in a closed system
[11:00] is always decreasing.
[11:04] The most common way to describe
entropy is as disorder,
[11:08] which makes sense because
it is associated with things
[11:10] becoming more mixed,
random, and less ordered.
[11:14] But I think the best way
to think about entropy
[11:16] is as the tendency of
energy to spread out.
[11:19] So why does energy spread out over time?
[11:22] I mean, most of the laws of physics
[11:24] work exactly the same way
forwards or backwards in time.
[11:28] So how does this clear
time dependence arise?
[11:34] Well, let's consider two small metal bars,
[11:36] one hot and one cold.
[11:38] For this simple model,
[11:40] we'll consider only eight atoms per bar.
[11:43] Each atom vibrates according to the number
[11:45] of energy packets it has.
[11:46] The more packets, the more it vibrates.
[11:49] So let's start with
seven packets of energy
[11:51] in the left bar and three in the right.
[11:54] The number of energy packets in each bar
[11:55] is what we'll call a state.
[11:58] First, let's consider just the left bar.
[12:01] It has seven energy packets,
[12:02] which are free to move around the lattice.
[12:05] This happens nonstop.
[12:06] The energy packets hop
randomly from atom to atom
[12:09] giving different configurations of energy,
[12:12] but the total energy stays
the same the whole time.
[12:16] Now, let's bring the cold bar back in
[12:18] with only three packets
and touch them together.
[12:21] The energy packets can now hop around
[12:22] between both bars creating
different configurations.
[12:26] Each unique configuration
is equally likely.
[12:30] So what happens if we take a
snapshot at one instant in time
[12:33] and see where all the energy packets are?
[12:36] So stop, look at this.
[12:39] Now there are nine energy
packets in the left bar,
[12:43] and only one in the right bar.
[12:45] So heat has flowed from cold to hot.
[12:49] Shouldn't that be impossible
because it decreases entropy?
[12:53] Well, this is where Ludwig Boltzmann
[12:55] made an important insight.
[12:57] Heat flowing from cold
to hot is not impossible,
[13:01] it's just improbable.
[13:04] There are 91,520 configurations
[13:07] with nine energy packets in the left bar,
[13:10] but 627,264 with five
energy packets in each bar.
[13:16] That is the energy is more than six times
[13:19] as likely to be evenly
spread between the bars.
[13:22] But if you add up all the possibilities,
[13:24] you find there's still a
10.5% chance that the left bar
[13:28] ends up with more energy
packets than it started.
[13:32] So, why don't we observe
this happening around us?
[13:36] Well, watch what happens as we
increase the number of atoms
[13:38] to 80 per bar and the
energy packets to 100,
[13:42] with 70 in the left bar
and 30 in the right.
[13:45] There is now only a 0.05%
chance that the left solid
[13:49] ends up hotter than it started.
[13:52] And this trend continues as
we keep scaling up the system.
[13:55] In everyday solids, there
are around 100 trillion,
[13:59] trillion atoms and even
more energy packets.
[14:02] So heat flowing from cold
to hot is just so unlikely
[14:06] that it never happens.
[14:10] Think of it like this Rubik's cube.
[14:12] Right now, it is completely solved,
[14:14] but I'm gonna close my eyes
and make some turns at random.
[14:18] If I keep doing this, it
will get further and further
[14:21] from being solved.
[14:22] But how can I be confident
that I'm really messing
[14:26] this cube up?
[14:27] Well, because there's only
one way for it to be solved,
[14:30] a few ways for it to be almost solved,
[14:32] and quintillions of ways
[14:34] for it to be almost entirely random.
[14:36] Without thought and effort,
[14:38] every turn moves the Rubik's cube
[14:40] from a highly unlikely state
that of it being solved
[14:43] to a more likely state, a total mess.
[14:50] So if the natural tendency
of energy is to spread out
[14:53] and for things to get messier,
[14:55] then how is it possible to have something
[14:57] like air conditioning where
the cold interior of a house
[15:01] gets cooler and the hot
exterior gets hotter?
[15:06] Energy is going from cold to hot,
[15:08] decreasing the entropy of the house.
[15:12] Well, this decrease in
entropy is only possible
[15:16] by increasing the entropy a
greater amount somewhere else.
[15:20] In this case, at a power plant,
[15:21] the concentrated chemical energy
and coal is being released,
[15:26] heating up the power
plant in its environment,
[15:28] spreading to the turbine
the electric generators,
[15:31] heating the wires all
the way to the house,
[15:33] and producing waste heat
in the fans and compressor.
[15:37] Whatever decrease in entropy
is achieved at the house
[15:40] is more than paid for by an
increase in entropy required
[15:44] to make that happen.
[15:47] But if total entropy is
constantly increasing
[15:50] and anything we do only
accelerates that increase,
[15:54] then how is there any
structure left on earth?
[15:58] How are there hot parts
separate from cold parts?
[16:01] How does life exist?
[16:05] Well, if the earth were a closed system,
[16:07] the energy would spread out completely,
[16:09] meaning, all life would cease,
[16:12] everything would decay and mix,
[16:14] and eventually, reach
the same temperature.
[16:17] But luckily, earth is not a closed system,
[16:21] because we have the sun.
[16:28] What the sun really gives
us is a steady stream
[16:31] of low entropy that is
concentrated bundled up energy.
[16:35] The energy that we get
from the sun is more useful
[16:39] than the energy we give back.
[16:41] It's more compact, it's
more clumped together.
[16:44] Plants capture this
energy and use it to grow
[16:46] and create sugars.
[16:48] Then animals eat plants
and use that energy
[16:51] to maintain their bodies and move around.
[16:54] Bigger animals get their energy
[16:55] by eating smaller animals and so on.
[16:58] And each step of the way,
[17:00] the energy becomes more spread out.
[17:03] - Okay, interesting.
[17:04] - Yeah.
[17:05] - Oh wow, I did not know that.
[17:06] - There you go.
[17:08] Ultimately, all the energy
that reaches earth from the sun
[17:11] is converted into thermal energy,
[17:13] and then it's radiated back into space.
[17:17] But in fact, it's the same amount.
[17:19] I know this is a-
- You do know this is...
[17:21] - I'm a PhD physicist.
[17:23] - Oh, okay, but anyway, so...
- I trust you.
[17:27] The increase in entropy can be seen
[17:29] in the relative number
of photons arriving at
[17:32] and leaving the earth.
[17:34] For each photon received from the sun,
[17:38] 20 photons are emitted,
[17:40] and everything that happens on earth,
[17:42] plants growing, trees
falling, herds stampeding,
[17:46] hurricanes and tornadoes, people eating,
[17:49] sleeping, and breathing.
[17:51] All of it happens in the
process of converting fewer,
[17:55] higher energy photons
[17:57] into 20 times as many
lower energy photons.
[18:01] Without a source of concentrated energy
[18:03] and a way to discard
the spread out energy,
[18:06] life on earth would not be possible.
[18:10] It has even been
suggested that life itself
[18:12] may be a consequence of the
second law of thermodynamics.
[18:16] If the universe tends
toward maximum entropy,
[18:19] then life offers a way to
accelerate that natural tendency,
[18:23] because life is spectacularly good
[18:26] at converting low entropy
into high entropy.
[18:29] For example, the surface
layer of seawater produces
[18:32] between 30 to 680% more
entropy when cyanobacteria
[18:38] and other organic matter is
present than when it's not.
[18:42] Jeremy England takes
this one step further.
[18:45] He's proposed that if
there is a constant stream
[18:48] of clumped up energy, this
could favor structures
[18:51] that dissipate that energy.
[18:53] And over time, this results
[18:55] in better and better energy dissipators,
[18:57] eventually resulting in life.
[19:00] Or in his own words,
[19:01] "You start with a random clump of atoms,
[19:03] and if you shine light
on it for long enough,
[19:06] it should not be so surprising
that you get a plant."
[19:11] So life on earth survives on
the low entropy from the sun,
[19:15] but then where did the
sun get its low entropy?
[19:19] The answer is the universe.
[19:22] If we know that the total
entropy of the universe
[19:25] is increasing with time, then
it was lower entropy yesterday
[19:29] and even lower entropy
the day before that,
[19:31] and so on, all the way
back to the Big Bang.
[19:37] So right after the Big Bang,
[19:38] that is when the entropy was lowest.
[19:41] This is known as the past hypothesis.
[19:44] It doesn't explain why
the entropy was low,
[19:47] just that it must have been
that way for the universe
[19:49] to unfold as it has.
[19:51] But the early universe was hot, dense,
[19:54] and almost completely uniform.
[19:56] I mean, everything was
mixed and the temperature
[19:59] was basically the same everywhere,
[20:01] varying by at most 0.001%.
[20:05] So how is this low entropy?
[20:09] Well, the thing we've left out is gravity.
[20:11] Gravity tends to clump matter together.
[20:15] So taking gravity into account,
[20:16] having matter all spread out like this,
[20:19] would be an extremely unlikely state,
[20:21] and that is why it's low entropy.
[20:26] Over time, as the universe
expanded and cooled,
[20:29] matter started to clump
together in more dense regions.
[20:33] And in doing so, enormous
amounts of potential energy
[20:36] were turned into kinetic energy.
[20:38] And this energy could also be used
[20:41] like how water flowing
downhill can power a turbine.
[20:45] But as bits of matter
started hitting each other,
[20:48] some of their kinetic energy
was converted into heat.
[20:51] So the amount of useful energy decreased.
[20:55] Thereby, increasing entropy.
[20:58] Over time, the useful energy was used.
[21:01] In doing so, stars, planets,
galaxies, and life were formed,
[21:06] increasing entropy all along.
[21:09] The universe started with around 10
[21:11] to the 88 Boltzmann
constants worth of entropy.
[21:15] Nowadays, all the stars
in the observable universe
[21:17] have about 9.5 times 10 to the 80.
[21:20] The interstellar and
intergalactic medium combined
[21:23] have almost 10 times more,
[21:25] but still only a fraction
of the early universe.
[21:29] A lot more is contained in neutrinos
[21:31] and in photons of the
cosmic microwave background.
[21:36] In 1972, Jacob Bekenstein proposed
[21:39] another source of entropy, black holes.
[21:46] He suggested that the
entropy of a black hole
[21:48] should be proportional
to its surface area.
[21:51] So as a black hole grows,
its entropy increases.
[21:55] Famous physicists thought
the idea was nonsense
[21:58] and for good reason.
[21:59] According to classical thermodynamics,
[22:01] if black holes have entropy,
[22:03] then they should also have a temperature.
[22:05] But if they have temperatures,
they should emit radiation
[22:09] and not be black after all.
[22:12] The person who set out
to prove Bekenstein wrong
[22:15] was Stephen Hawking.
[22:17] But to his surprise, his
results showed that black holes
[22:20] do emit radiation, now
known as Hawking radiation,
[22:24] and they do have a temperature.
[22:27] The black hole at the
center of the Milky Way
[22:29] has a temperature of about a
hundred trillionth of a Kelvin,
[22:33] emitting radiation that
is far too weak to detect.
[22:36] So still pretty black.
[22:38] But Hawking confirmed that
black holes have entropy
[22:40] and Bekenstein was right.
[22:43] Hawking was able to refine
Bekenstein's proposal
[22:46] and determine just how
much entropy they have.
[22:49] The super massive black hole
at the center of the Milky Way
[22:51] has about 10 to the 91
Boltzmann constants of entropy.
[22:56] That is 1,000 times as much
[22:58] as the early observable universe,
[23:00] and 10 times more than all
the other particles combined.
[23:04] And that is just one black hole.
[23:06] All black holes together
account for 3 times 10
[23:09] to the 104 Boltzmann
constants worth of entropy.
[23:14] So almost all the entropy of the universe
[23:17] is tied up in black holes.
[23:19] That means, the early universe
[23:21] only had about 0.000000000000003%
of the entropy it has now.
[23:31] So the entropy was low,
and everything that happens
[23:35] in the universe like
planetary systems forming,
[23:37] galaxies merging, asteroids crashing,
[23:40] stars dying, to life itself flourishing,
[23:44] all of that can happen because the entropy
[23:46] of the universe was low
and it has been increasing,
[23:50] and it all happens only in one direction.
[23:52] We never see an asteroid uncrash
[23:55] or a planetary system unmix
[23:57] into the cloud of dust
and gas that made it up.
[24:00] There is a clear difference
between going to the past
[24:03] and the future, and that
difference comes from entropy.
[24:07] The fact that we are going from unlikely
[24:09] to more likely states is why
there is an arrow of time.
[24:16] This is expected to
continue until eventually,
[24:20] the energy gets spread out so completely
[24:22] that nothing interesting
will ever happen again.
[24:26] This is the heat death of the universe.
[24:29] In the distant future,
[24:31] more than 10 to the 100 years from now,
[24:33] after the last black hole has evaporated,
[24:36] the universe will be in
its most probable state.
[24:40] Now, even on large scales,
you would not be able to tell
[24:43] the difference between time
moving forwards or backwards,
[24:46] and the arrow of time
itself would disappear.
[24:52] So it sounds like entropy
is this awful thing
[24:55] that leads us inevitably
[24:57] towards the dullest outcome imaginable.
[25:00] But just because maximum
entropy has low complexity
[25:03] does not mean that low entropy
has maximum complexity.
[25:07] It's actually more like this tea and milk.
[25:09] I mean, holding it like this
is not very interesting.
[25:12] But as I pour the milk
in, the two start to mix
[25:17] and these beautiful patterns emerge.
[25:20] They arise in an instant
and before you know it,
[25:23] they're gone back to being featureless.
[25:26] Both low and high entropy
are low in complexity.
[25:30] It's in the middle
where complex structures
[25:33] appear and thrive.
[25:35] And since that's where we find ourselves,
[25:37] let's make use of the low
entropy we've got while we can.
[25:47] With the right tools, we can
understand just about anything,
[25:50] from a cup of tea cooling down
[25:52] to the evolution of the entire universe.
