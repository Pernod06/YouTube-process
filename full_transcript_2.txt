[00:03] over half of all animals in the open
[00:06] ocean drift in
[00:16] currents jellyfish cross entire oceans
[00:20] feeding on whatever happens to tangle
[00:23] with their
[00:28] tentacles some can grow to a meter even
[00:31] 2 m
[00:33] across and when by Lucky chance they
[00:37] encounter a patch of sea rich in
[00:39] Plankton their numbers explode
[00:49] [Music]
[01:14] [Music]
[01:25] it's such a successful strategy the
[01:28] jellies are one one of the most common
[01:31] life forms on the
[01:41] planet but among the jellies and looking
[01:44] somewhat like them is a rather more
[01:47] complex and Sinister
[01:54] creature the Portuguese man of war
[02:03] it floats with the help of a gas filled
[02:05] bladder topped by a vertical
[02:09] membrane with that serving as a sail it
[02:13] maintains a steady course through the
[02:15] waves
[02:24] [Music]
[02:30] [Music]
[02:40] long threads trail behind it some as
[02:43] much as 30 m
[02:46] [Music]
[02:48] long each is armed with many thousands
[02:51] of stinging
[02:54] cells a single tentacle could kill a
[02:57] fish or in rare cases a human
[03:05] but among its lethal tentacles LS a Mana
[03:09] War fish that feeds by nibbling
[03:18] them once this fish has some resistance
[03:21] to the stings it must still be extremely
[03:27] careful most other fish are not so
[03:33] [Music]
[03:41] [Applause]
[03:42] [Music]
[03:51] lucky a tentacle has caught this one and
[03:54] reels it in
[04:07] it's already
[04:13] paralyzed specialized muscular tentacles
[04:16] transfer the victim to others that
[04:18] digest the catch liquefying it with
[04:22] powerful chemicals
[04:26] [Applause]
[04:30] eventually all that is
[04:34] left is a scaly
[04:44] husk this voracious man of war May
[04:47] collect over a 100 small fish in a day
[04:51] [Music]
[05:04] [Music]
[05:19] the struggle to survive in our green
[05:21] Seas can have far reaching
[05:26] consequences once a year one particular
[05:29] particular Meadow in Australia is
[05:39] transformed around the first full moon
[05:43] of winter an army
[05:49] materializes spider crabs
[05:59] for the past year they've been feeding
[06:01] in deeper
[06:13] waters now they march across the
[06:16] seagrass plains
[06:26] [Music]
[06:36] hundreds of thousands of
[06:40] [Music]
[06:46] them they clamber over one
[06:54] another creating great Mounds
[06:59] [Music]
[07:03] nearly 100 m
[07:08] long they're not seeking mates neither
[07:12] are they laying
[07:13] eggs they have come here in order to
[07:20] grow like all crabs their bodies are
[07:23] enclosed in a hard unexpandable shell
[07:29] so to grow they have to break out of
[07:42] it and that allows the soft one that has
[07:46] developed beneath to
[07:55] expand it will take days for the new
[07:58] shell to Haren
[08:12] its legs are so limp that they won't
[08:14] work
[08:18] properly the crab is
[08:21] unprotected and in great Danger
[08:32] a smooth
[08:37] Stingray it's huge about 4 M
[08:42] long it wants a soft freshly melted crab
[08:46] that will be easier to eat
[09:10] the crabs try to stick
[09:19] together but now disturbed by the ray
[09:23] they're scattering
[09:30] a newly molded
[09:32] crab is too weak to keep up with the
[09:49] crowd the safest place is right in the
[09:52] middle of the
[09:54] pile that is why they have all assembled
[09:58] here
[10:07] there is safety in
[10:24] numbers but the vast majority of the
[10:27] crabs Escape
[10:29] and within the next few days they will
[10:32] be ready to return to the depths and
[10:34] resume their lonely wanderings in search
[10:37] of
[10:50] food this is no
[10:54] graveyard but the Triumph of 100,000
[10:58] crabs successfully
[11:06] molted a Sally Lightfoot
[11:11] crab one of thousands of shore crabs
[11:14] just waiting for their
[11:18] moment every day they gather on the
[11:21] tropical shores of
[11:24] [Music]
[11:25] Brazil waiting for the tide to go out
[11:30] [Music]
[11:37] which exposes their feeding
[11:40] grounds seaweed covered rocks 100 m from
[11:44] the
[11:54] shore getting there is a race against
[11:57] the tide
[12:05] they leap from rock to
[12:13] [Music]
[12:19] [Music]
[12:20] rock these crabs seem to be afraid of
[12:24] the water
[12:37] and for good
[12:50] reason the Moray
[12:54] eel the chain Mor is a specialist crab
[12:58] Hunter
[13:05] its blunt teeth can easily grip and
[13:07] crush a crab's
[13:10] [Music]
[13:14] shell it's the crabb's deadliest
[13:21] [Music]
[13:27] enemy but the crabs feeding grounds are
[13:30] still a long way
[13:37] off they must Press On
[14:05] [Music]
[14:08] halfway but the enemy has other
[14:12] [Music]
[14:17] ideas crossing the
[14:25] land to reset the ambush
[14:32] to feed the crabs must keep
[14:40] going but nowhere is
[14:46] safe an octopus also a crab killer
[15:16] the crabs make a dash for it
[15:45] made
[15:50] [Music]
[15:54] it risking life and limb to graze on
[15:58] these seaweed
[16:01] [Music]
[16:02] pastures but in 2 hours time when the
[16:06] tide starts to
[16:08] turn they will have to run the gauntlet
[16:10] all over
[16:20] [Music]
[16:23] again in a far corner of Southeast Asia
[16:27] lies the Cor Coral
[16:32] triangle a cluster of the richest coral
[16:36] reefs in the
[16:37] [Music]
[16:42] world undersea cities crammed full of
[16:52] life as in any crowded Metropolis there
[16:56] is fierce rivalry for space
[17:03] for
[17:08] food and for a
[17:12] partner but the reef is also a Place
[17:15] full of opportunity
[17:17] [Music]
[17:30] a
[17:47] cuttlefish it specializes in hunting
[17:51] crabs
[17:56] [Music]
[18:00] but a large crab is a dangerous
[18:11] Quarry it has powerful
[18:17] claws the Cuttlefish however has a
[18:20] remarkable
[18:26] Talent its skin contains millions of
[18:29] pigment cells with which it can create
[18:32] everchanging colors and
[18:39] [Music]
[18:43] patterns and that apparently hypnotizes
[18:47] the crab
[18:51] [Music]
[19:10] a cuttlefish may be clever but a shark
[19:13] is
[19:15] bigger and it eats
[19:20] cuttlefish time to disappear
[19:23] [Music]
[19:29] [Music]
[19:39] back to the
[19:42] hunt a new Target but the same
[19:46] mesmerizing technique
[19:55] [Music]
[20:03] for those that manage to establish
[20:06] themselves in these bustling undersea
[20:09] cities there can be great
[20:14] rewards during the dry season over half
[20:18] a million turns crowed onto this remote
[20:21] ATL in the Indian Ocean
[20:30] their chicks are still in their dark
[20:32] juvenile
[20:38] plumage they vary in
[20:43] [Music]
[20:48] age whilst the more advanced chicks take
[20:51] to the air
[20:53] [Music]
[21:00] others aren't quite ready
[21:05] [Music]
[21:21] yet those just starting to learn to fly
[21:25] use the shallow Lagoon that occupies the
[21:28] center of the at all as their training
[21:32] ground it's difficult for some of them
[21:35] to stay a loft for long
[21:38] [Applause]
[21:50] [Music]
[22:00] giant
[22:14] treales usually they are solitary
[22:18] Hunters but about 50 of them have come
[22:21] here from neighboring reefs attracted by
[22:23] this abundance of potential prey
[22:32] [Applause]
[22:34] the fledglings stay out of the water if
[22:37] they
[22:38] can they even drink on the wing
[22:42] [Music]
[22:59] if the chali to catch one now they have
[23:03] to up their
[23:05] [Music]
[23:13] game so there is a fish here that
[23:16] amazingly has a brain capable of
[23:20] calculating the air speed altitude and
[23:23] trajectory of a bird
[23:56] the time comes when every fledgling has
[23:59] to take to the air and collect food for
[24:09] [Music]
[24:25] itself their parents lead them to the
[24:28] training grounds
[24:36] [Music]
[24:58] a
[25:11] [Music]
[25:26] [Music]
[25:50] [Music]
[26:03] [Music]
[26:04] if they are to
[26:06] survive they must learn
[26:09] [Music]
[26:16] quickly after a month of practicing over
[26:19] the Lagoon the youngsters start to leave
[26:22] and take their chances out over the Open
[26:24] Sea
[26:34] out here on the sand Flats there is safe
[26:37] accommodation for
[26:47] some a family of Saddle black clown fish
[26:51] have found an excellent
[26:55] home the tentacles of this carpet nemon
[26:59] can
[27:01] kill but the clown fish are immune to
[27:04] the
[27:05] [Music]
[27:10] poison so they can shelter from
[27:14] [Music]
[27:18] danger in return the fish keep the
[27:21] anemon clean of
[27:24] [Music]
[27:27] debris as with all clownfish the family
[27:30] is ruled by a big
[27:33] female her white face marks her out as
[27:37] the
[27:42] boss the Domin of maale has to prove his
[27:45] worth so he works
[27:48] tirelessly removing debris and generally
[27:51] keeping on top of the housework
[27:59] [Music]
[28:14] his greatest challenge is to find a safe
[28:17] place where the boss can lay her
[28:23] eggs but there's nothing solid here for
[28:26] the female to lay them on
[28:33] a nearby shell could be the
[28:46] solution if only he can move it to the
[28:49] protection of the anemon
[28:54] [Music]
[28:59] too
[29:03] heavy besides it has a mind of its
[29:09] own hermit
[29:20] crab but out here twice a day the anemon
[29:25] is swept by tidal currents and they
[29:27] bring in new
[29:31] opportunities an old plastic
[29:38] bottle perhaps this will
[29:47] do not heavy enough
[29:55] [Music]
[30:02] a coconut
[30:05] [Music]
[30:07] shell it looks just right but it's a
[30:12] long way from home
[30:23] [Music]
[30:32] and he can't move it by
[30:43] [Music]
[30:46] himself so the pair now work together
[30:51] [Music]
[31:15] [Music]
[31:21] on
[31:26] [Music]
[31:31] a little adjustment to the anemon
[31:33] tentacles in order to clear a space for
[31:38] it and the shell is tucked
[31:43] [Music]
[31:46] in the female
[31:48] lays a safe Nursery at last
[31:54] [Music]
[32:08] he has proved himself worthy to Father
[32:10] her young and he fertilizes
[32:13] [Music]
[32:17] them now he will meticulously tend the
[32:20] eggs
[32:24] [Music]
[32:29] keeping them clean and healthy until
[32:31] they
[32:32] hatch in 10 days
[32:35] [Music]
[32:46] [Music]
[32:54] time the blue shark
[33:03] it travels over 8,000 km a year riding
[33:06] on the currents supported by its broad
[33:09] wing-shaped
[33:15] fins this one may not have eaten for 2
[33:25] months but the currents can carry pring
[33:28] traces of fatty oils from many
[33:30] kilometers away and will lead it to its
[33:33] next
[33:35] [Music]
[33:40] meal after days of travel the smell of
[33:43] food gets stronger
[34:00] [Music]
[34:07] a dead whale recently struck by a
[34:13] ship this could be a real Feast but the
[34:17] blue shark must be cautious
[34:29] great white
[34:33] sharks 10 times heavier than a
[34:38] blue a highly possessive around a whale
[34:41] carcass
[35:09] great whites are eager to feed on energy
[35:11] rich whale blubber which we now know
[35:14] forms a major part of their diet
[35:25] [Music]
[35:29] once the great white has had its fill
[35:31] smaller sharks like the blue shark
[35:34] tackle what's left of a
[35:45] carcass as the oils from this dead whale
[35:48] spread more widely more and more blue
[35:51] sharks appear
[35:58] [Music]
[36:13] within days the carcass will be stripped
[36:16] of its
[36:25] blubber then no longer longer kept
[36:28] buoyant by its oil it will sink Into the
[36:31] Depths
[36:35] below the blue with its reserves of fat
[36:39] replenished can now survive for another
[36:41] 2 months without
[36:55] eating but most of the creatures come
[36:58] together for a very different
[37:01] reason to
[37:07] breed the giant
[37:10] cuttlefish the largest of all
[37:13] [Music]
[37:19] cuttlefish they live for just one or two
[37:22] years
[37:29] now as the Australian summer draws to an
[37:32] end they have one last act
[37:39] complete to find a
[37:45] mate but there are over 100,000 males
[37:50] competing for the arriving females in
[37:53] this one Bay
[38:00] among them a giant a true Goliath he
[38:04] probably weighs about 10
[38:09] kilos bands of color sweep across his
[38:13] skin that's how cuttlefish communicate
[38:35] this smaller male couldn't possibly take
[38:38] him
[38:41] [Music]
[38:48] on beside Goliath and under his
[38:51] protection a female who has just mated
[38:54] with him
[38:58] but other Rivals are still
[39:04] interested it seems a small male
[39:06] wouldn't stand a
[39:09] chance the female is now displaying a
[39:12] white stripe along her side nearest
[39:18] Goliath it's a clear signal that she no
[39:20] longer wants to mate with him
[39:26] [Music]
[39:28] it's all the encouragement that the
[39:30] little male
[39:34] [Music]
[39:53] needs he's going to have to use trickery
[40:03] [Music]
[40:11] he tones down his colors and Tucks in
[40:16] his
[40:18] arms he's just the right size to mimic a
[40:21] female
[40:25] [Music]
[40:33] Goliath is
[40:37] deceived the small male now displays a
[40:41] white stripe just like the real female
[40:44] to deter his
[40:51] advances he slips beside
[40:56] her and they
[41:02] [Music]
[41:08] meet by meting with multiple
[41:12] partners the female ensures the greatest
[41:16] genetic diversity for her
[41:23] young the sneaky male leaves
[41:28] his final Act
[41:32] [Music]
[41:34] complete so even among giant cuttlefish
[41:37] it
[41:40] seems it's not all about
[41:53] size in the underwater forests of
[41:56] Northern Japan
[41:58] the residents of this sunken wreck are
[42:01] waiting for the summer temperatures to
[42:03] reach 16°
[42:09] [Music]
[42:16] cus that for some is the time for mating
[42:32] [Music]
[42:35] a kind of giant Rass called a cobod
[42:44] die this is a
[42:47] [Music]
[42:51] male and in female terms he's
[42:54] particularly handsome
[43:02] [Music]
[43:03] he's a meter long and weighs 15
[43:07] [Music]
[43:09] kilos much larger than the dimin
[43:14] [Music]
[43:16] female and he is ready to
[43:22] breed he attempts to mate with
[43:25] her and with any of the other dozen or
[43:28] so females that live in his
[43:31] territory whenever he gets the
[43:39] [Music]
[43:47] chance but females from around 10 years
[43:50] old take little notice of his advances
[44:00] [Music]
[44:10] [Music]
[44:22] this is because when any large female
[44:25] reaches a critical body size
[44:27] she can begin a dramatic
[44:47] transformation over just a few months
[44:50] particular enzymes inside her body cease
[44:53] to
[44:55] work and male hormones start to
[45:03] circulate as time
[45:06] passes her head
[45:08] expands and her chin gets
[45:13] longer a she has changed into a he
[45:27] and with this comes a change in
[45:36] temperament the old male who ruled all
[45:38] the females
[45:41] here is challenged to a face
[45:50] off the more bulbous the head the more
[45:54] it intimidates an opponent
[45:59] [Music]
[46:21] [Music]
[46:23] the territory has a new ruler
[46:38] only the largest females transform
[46:41] themselves in this
[46:47] way but the change enables them to have
[46:50] more mates so they will have many more
[46:53] offspring carrying their jeans
[46:56] [Music]
[47:02] but a new male can't afford to be
[47:06] complacent inside the body of every
[47:09] codai
[47:10] female there is a new maale in
[47:23] waiting and wave power creates towering
[47:26] fortresses like these cliffs in the
[47:29] Arctic home to tens of thousands of
[47:32] breeding
[47:37] seabirds the faces of the cliffs are
[47:40] accessible only from the air and have
[47:42] plenty of nooks and crannies for those
[47:45] that can get
[47:50] there but to feed seabirds must still
[47:53] Master the ocean World Beyond
[48:01] a
[48:05] puffin he's a
[48:08] fisherman and a
[48:13] father he has a mate for
[48:17] [Music]
[48:19] [Applause]
[48:23] life both share the burden of raising
[48:26] their weak old chick their puffling who
[48:29] needs five square meals a
[48:33] day the parents alternate fishing
[48:38] [Music]
[48:40] trips it's Dad's turn
[48:50] [Music]
[49:05] when fish stocks are low puffins must
[49:08] fly as much as 50 km out to
[49:11] sea to reach the good fishing grounds
[49:16] [Music]
[49:27] once there they plunge into another
[49:38] world good fishing spots are hard to
[49:41] come by and they have
[49:44] company
[49:53] gilot like the Puffin their wings are
[49:56] short and good for
[50:00] diving puffins can hold their breath for
[50:03] over a minute and dive as deep as 40
[50:11] m a catch
[50:32] but it's a long way
[50:48] home after an exhausting round trip of
[50:51] almost 100 km this puffins nearly made
[50:54] it
[50:58] but there are pirates on this
[51:02] Coast Arctic skewers
[51:11] [Music]
[51:30] all around returning parents are being
[51:33] robbed
[51:51] [Music]
[52:00] the skewers long rback Wings make them
[52:03] faster and more maneuverable
[52:05] [Music]
[52:18] [Music]
[52:43] puffins must choose their moment wisely
[52:56] [Music]
[53:07] a near
[53:12] [Music]
[53:25] Miss the last desperate burst of
[53:30] speed and it's made it
[53:41] [Music]
[53:55] [Music]
[53:59] safely home after a 3-hour round
[54:05] [Music]
[54:09] trip where his patient partner is
[54:12] waiting
[54:14] [Music]
[54:23] [Music]
[54:27] [Applause]
[54:29] today their puffling will
[54:32] [Music]
[54:38] eat but where fish numbers are in
[54:41] Decline many puffins Now find it hard to
[54:44] get enough food for their
[54:48] chicks in the changing Seas of today it
[54:51] can be even harder to be a successful
[54:54] Puffin parent
[54:56] [Music]
[55:05] a kilometer from the surface beyond the
[55:08] reach of the
[55:14] Sun a giant black void larger than all
[55:19] the rest of the world's habitats
[55:21] combined
[55:27] there's life
[55:29] here but not as we know
[55:42] it alien-like creatures produce dazzling
[55:46] displays of light
[56:00] nearly all animals need to attract mates
[56:03] and repel
[56:06] Predators this language of light is so
[56:09] widespread here that these signals are
[56:12] probably the commonest form of
[56:15] communication on the entire
[56:18] planet and yet we still know little
[56:21] about them
[56:34] [Music]
[56:41] [Music]

[01:00:02] [Music]
[01:00:21] over millions of years it forms a layer
[01:00:24] of mud up to a kilometer
[01:00:30] thick it's an empty plane that covers
[01:00:34] half the surface of our planet
[01:00:36] [Music]
[01:01:02] the Deep seab bed May at first appear

[01:01:37] patience this fish has been living for
[01:01:40] so long here that its fins have changed
[01:01:43] into something more
[01:01:49] [Music]
[01:01:50] useful feet
[01:01:55] [Music]

[01:02:19] Flor the flapjack octopus
[01:02:27] it hovers just above the surface of the
[01:02:29] mud as it delicately sifts through it
[01:02:32] searching for
[01:02:36] worms but it can jet away at the first
[01:02:40] sign of danger
[01:02:52] [Music]
[01:03:05] in the Gulf of Mexico these eruptions
[01:03:08] also release a super salty
[01:03:18] liquid Brian
[01:03:22] [Music]
[01:03:32] it's heavier than
[01:03:33] seawat and it accumulates in great pools
[01:03:37] on the seaf
[01:03:42] floor it's difficult to make sense of
[01:03:45] the
[01:03:52] site a lake of concentrated salt water
[01:03:57] 15 M
[01:03:58] deep at the bottom of the
[01:04:05] [Applause]
[01:04:08] sea around its margin perhaps even more
[01:04:11] strangely there is a profusion of
[01:04:21] life giant muscles that can live and
[01:04:24] grow for a century or more pack tightly
[01:04:27] together dwarfing the shrimps and squat
[01:04:29] lobsters that feed around them

[01:06:17] [Applause]
[01:06:26] it manages to
