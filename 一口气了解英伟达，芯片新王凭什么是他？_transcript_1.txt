一口气了解英伟达，芯片新王凭什么是他？
======================================================================

[00:01] On May 24,
[00:02] Nvidia released their first quarter earnings
[00:04] Many investors are calling this an unprecedented
[00:06] once in a lifetime release
[00:08] Nvidia relied on
[00:09] the dazzling data
[00:10] giving Wall Street a slap in the face
[00:12] The stock soared by 30% on the day
[00:13] Market cap reached trillion of dollars
[00:15] propelled Nvidia into becoming sixth-largest company in the world
[00:17] surpassing Tesla
[00:18] and approaching Amazon
[00:19] Who would have thought that
[00:20] a company selling graphics cards
[00:22] would become the biggest winner
[00:23] in the AI ​​war in 2023
[00:26] For the past few years
[00:27] Nvidia participated in almost all of global tech innovation
[00:29] cloud computing
[00:29] cryptocurrency
[00:30] Metaverse
[00:30] Artificial Intelligence
[00:31] Nvidia is main player in all these
[00:32] Majority of the AI model you’ve heard of
[00:34] are trained with Nvidia graphics cards.
[00:36] Not only are they an industry leader
[00:37] but they monopolised global AI training industry
[00:39] by occupying 95% market share
[00:41] Even the quantity of owning
[00:42] Nvidia A100 graphics cards
[00:44] an indicator to measure a company’s computational power
[00:47] The founder, Jensen Huang said
[00:51] Sounds arrogant right
[00:52] But that’s the truth
[00:57] With his foresight from over 20 years
[00:59] and his unchanging outfit style
[01:01] becomes the Godfather of AI
[01:03] You must be wondering
[01:05] what’s so great about Nvidia
[01:06] How did they monopolise?
[01:07] Why nobody can compete against them
[01:08] Today let Lin take you down a trip
[01:10] to the story of Nvidia
[01:11] We’ll also talk about the secret behind
[01:13] graphic card and chip industry
[01:17] Let’s begin with the rise of
[01:19] Jensen Huang and Nvidia
[01:21] In 1963
[01:22] Jensen Huang was born in Tainan, Taiwan
[01:24] which means he is 60 years old this year
[01:26] At the age of 9, he moved to US
[01:28] after graduating from college
[01:29] he worked in two semiconductor companies
[01:30] focusing on chip design
[01:31] one of them is AMD
[01:33] a company that fought with Jensen
[01:34] for half of their lifetime
[01:35] until now
[01:38] After finishing his Master at Stanford, Jensen turned 30
[01:40] With two other tech guys who were
[01:42] also in their 30s with big ambition
[01:44] they planned to do something big
[01:46] They believed that 3D graphics processing
[01:48] has great potential in the future
[01:49] So in 1993
[01:50] they established NVIDIA
[01:52] specialises in graphic processing chip
[01:54] Jensen Huang is the CEO.
[01:56] he still is today
[01:57] With recommendation from his former boss
[01:58] he obtained $20 million capital investment
[02:00] from Sequoia Capital
[02:02] After all gaming industry needs real-time rendering when playing
[02:04] You can’t say there’s no 3D games
[02:06] but definitely can’t play with normal computer
[02:07] Many games are quite classic
[02:09] but the graphic
[02:09] is basically, well as long as you can see a figure there
[02:11] because this kind of 3D image processing
[02:13] is computationally intensive
[02:14] It was difficult for the CPU at that time
[02:16] Normally they need a specific chip
[02:18] to process the graphics
[02:19] and this chip is graphic card
[02:21] In the early days, the graphics card was very simple
[02:23] it was a 3D accelerator card at most
[02:26] Now when you hear 3D accelerator
[02:28] It sounds like a small workshop business
[02:29] That's right
[02:30] actually at that time 3D games and
[02:31] 3D rendering
[02:32] was at seeding stage
[02:33] Graphics card companies like Nvidia
[02:35] are actually a lot
[02:35] at least 50-60 companies
[02:37] There was no uniform standard for both hardware and software
[02:38] Whoever comes out with better research
[02:39] can publish their own standard.
[02:41] Often times
[02:41] when you finally came up with a graphics card
[02:43] but it actually is
[02:44] not compatible with other people’s standard
[02:46] Just one word
[02:47] Chaotic
[02:48] One of the most famous company at the time
[02:50] is a company called 3dfx
[02:51] It was established in 1994,
[02:53] a year later than Nvidia
[02:54] At that time, a graphics card called Voodoo
[02:56] was all the rage
[02:57] Many popular games during that time
[02:58] relied on Voodoo graphic card
[03:00] It wasn’t going so well with NVIDIA
[03:02] Although they obtained capitals
[03:03] and had very professional team
[03:05] but their NV1 was not successful
[03:07] NV2 was aborted
[03:10] By 1997
[03:11] NVIDIA was hanging on by a thread
[03:12] 9 more months till they run out of money
[03:14] The company downsized its staff from 100
[03:15] till there were about 30 people left
[03:17] Jensen Huang took a gamble
[03:19] Just when the company only had
[03:20] 6 months of operating capitals
[03:21] They released Riva128 graphic card carrying NV3
[03:24] With its good price/performance ratio,
[03:25] they finally occupy a place in the market
[03:28] and allow NVIDIA to survive
[03:30] Actually Jensen and his team
[03:32] are very strong in their R&D
[03:33] After they figure out
[03:34] the market direction
[03:36] they managed to enter fast lane quickly
[03:38] They reached a long-term strategic cooperation with TSMC
[03:40] At the same time they cooperate closely with Microsoft
[03:41] supported the Direct 3D display standard introduced by Microsoft
[03:44] Finally they rose in the sea
[03:46] of competition in graphics card industry
[03:46] With RivaTNT
[03:48] it helped
[03:49] NVIDIA to become
[03:50] industry leader in graphics card industry
[03:52] In 1999, NVIDIA
[03:53] successfully listed on NASDAQ
[03:56] After listing
[03:57] NVIDIA had more money and
[03:58] in September 1999, they released
[04:00] the epoch-making GeForce256
[04:02] which made them the leading force among their competitors
[04:05] I believe that gamers
[04:06] should be familiar with
[04:07] this GeForce series.
[04:08] It has also become Nvidia’s
[04:10] the flagship line of consumer graphics card
[04:11] Jensen Huang named GeForce256
[04:13] the world’s first GPU
[04:15] The first truly dedicated graphics card
[04:17] The claim is
[04:18] basically accepted by everyone
[04:19] Hence some people might generally claimed that
[04:21] Nvidia invented the graphics card.
[04:23] As for why this dedicated graphics card is so powerful,
[04:25] we will talk about it later.
[04:27] At that time, Microsoft happened to be working on Xbox
[04:29] With GeForce 256
[04:30] powerful performance, NVIDIA managed to
[04:32] score $200 million worth of order
[04:34] After building image processing hardware for Xbox
[04:36] they then score another with Sony’s PS3
[04:38] From 1999 to 2002,
[04:40] Nvidia’s revenue
[04:40] almost doubled every year to
[04:42] $2 billion
[04:43] becoming the only player in the market
[04:45] They started to acquire
[04:46] competitors in the same industry
[04:47] one of them we mentioned earlier
[04:49] the once popular 3dfx
[04:51] Another major player in the market
[04:53] ATi was acquired by AMD
[04:56] And so in the early 2000s
[04:57] after a series of merger and acquisition
[04:59] happening in the market
[05:01] There are only two players left in the market
[05:03] Nvidia and AMD.
[05:04] Until now, the dedicated graphics card market
[05:06] has been dominated by these two companies.
[05:08] I don’t know if you have heard of
[05:09] the legendary N card and A card
[05:11] actually refer to the graphics cards of these two companies.
[05:13] Gamers started to argue
[05:15] whether N card or A card is better
[05:16] It doesn’t matter which one is better
[05:17] after that there isn’t a
[05:18] third company exists in the market
[05:19] like B card of C card or X card
[05:21] It’s a two-horse race
[05:22] However NVIDIA is gradually
[05:25] eating away AMD’s market share
[05:27] from 60% in 2010
[05:28] slowly expanded to
[05:29] 80% in 2022.
[05:30] becoming global GPU hegemon
[05:33] The speed of development of GPU technology itself
[05:35] is also jaw-dropping
[05:36] The rapid development of gaming industry
[05:38] has supported Nvidia,
[05:39] At the same time, NVIDIA’s graphics card development
[05:41] has promoted the development of the gaming industry.
[05:43] Look at the new games coming out every year
[05:44] so much improvement in image quality
[05:46] Even if you don’t understand game
[05:47] you can see the speed of progress
[05:52] In fact, the overall graphics card market
[05:55] is in a tripartite state
[05:58] Three biggest player – INTEL, NVIDIA, AMD
[06:00] Intel occupied 71% of market share
[06:02] Nvidia is 17% and AMD is 12%.
[06:05] You must be wondering
[06:06] why is there Intel
[06:07] and their market share is way higher
[06:08] Didn’t you just say that Nvidia is the biggest player?
[06:12] Actually
[06:12] this graphics card is not the same graphics card
[06:16] Because graphics card
[06:17] is divided into dedicated and integrated graphics card
[06:19] If you were to compare both
[06:20] then Intel indeed is the biggest player
[06:22] but they sell mostly integrated graphics card
[06:24] Integrated graphics card is placed together with CPU
[06:26] they share memory
[06:27] So Intel taking advantage of their position in CPU industry
[06:29] monopolise the integrated graphics card market share
[06:31] However the integrated graphics card
[06:33] is quite weak, I won’t explain in details here
[06:35] Comparing with NVIDIA’s dedicated graphics card
[06:36] although they are both graphics card but they don’t belong in same market
[06:39] Just from dedicated graphics market POV
[06:40] NVIDIA occupied 80% of the market share
[06:41] Some of you might start to get bored now
[06:43] Alright we know
[06:44] NVIDIA designs graphics card and chips
[06:46] they are very good at it
[06:47] I’ve been talking a lot about
[06:48] 3D rendering and gaming
[06:49] How does it have anything to do with AI
[06:51] Why are all these AI companies want to buy graphics card
[06:52] and it has to be NVIDIA’s graphics card
[06:55] Don’t worry, we’ll talk about graphics card characteristic
[06:59] in a computer, Central Processing Unit
[07:01] The purpose of its design is that
[07:02] it can do everything
[07:03] It’s sequential computing
[07:04] and it can carry out very complex logical reasoning
[07:06] However image processing
[07:08] doesn’t care much about sequential computing
[07:09] It’s more concerned with computational volume
[07:10] For example, a 4k video
[07:12] has 10 million pixels
[07:13] Let’s say there’s 30 frames per second
[07:14] then each pixel and frame
[07:16] has to compute correspond colour
[07:17] based on
[07:18] shadow and action
[07:20] This requires non-stop, very fast
[07:22] and massive simple calculations
[07:23] is Graphics Processing Unit
[07:24] It’s especially designed to
[07:26] do this kind of computation
[07:27] The foundation of the chip design
[07:29] is to optimise parallel computing
[07:31] So for CPU
[07:32] is 64 or 128 core at best
[07:34] while GPU could have thousands of core
[07:36] computing together at the same time
[07:37] See this video is giving
[07:38] a very good explanation
[07:39] CPU is like a very precise
[07:41] very strong gun firing one shot at a time
[07:43] The shots are fired in clear order
[07:45] but slow,
[07:46] GPU on the other hand
[07:47] is like having thousands of this gun
[07:49] firing at the same time
[07:55] Due to GPU special feature
[07:56] Jensen Huang started to think about
[07:58] how to maximise
[07:59] its potential
[08:00] It’s definitely as simple as 3D image processing
[08:02] and rendering
[08:03] Can they carry out
[08:04] more of General Purpose Computing
[08:06] General Purpose Computing
[08:07] General Purpose Graphics Processing
[08:14] But it’s not simple to use GPU
[08:15] to do this kind of
[08:16] general purpose computing
[08:17] Because the purpose of its design is not for this
[08:19] so the programming is very difficult
[08:20] Not anyone can do this job
[08:22] Jensen Huang was thinking that
[08:22] if graphics card was to realise its greater potential
[08:24] it needs to be programmable
[08:26] By chance
[08:27] he saw a project by a
[08:28] PhD student in Stanford
[08:29] Using C language programming
[08:30] to let GPU do some computing
[08:31] Jensen thought this idea is amazing
[08:34] and offered this fella a job at NVIDIA
[08:36] He appointed him with a very important job
[08:38] and let him lead the team to carry out R&D
[08:40] in making GPU programmable
[08:44] Finally in 2006
[08:46] NVIDIA officially released CUDA
[08:47] making GPU programmable
[08:49] In order to build this CUDA system,
[08:50] NVIDIA invested a large and
[08:53] unreasonable amount of
[08:53] capitals and human resources into it
[08:54] Originally those graphics card that
[08:56] to support CUDA
[08:57] Originally those graphics card that
[08:59] specializes in 3D graphics processing
[09:00] need many top engineers to
[09:02] make it programmable
[09:04] But now anyone can do it by
[09:05] buying an NVIDIA graphics card
[09:07] and use it with
[09:08] CUDA library
[09:09] Through CUDA
[09:09] NVIDIA expanded the boundary of graphics card
[09:11] from gaming and 3D image processing
[09:13] to a whole realm of accelerated computing
[09:15] Like aerospace, biopharmaceuticals
[09:17] Weather forecasting, energy exploration and so on
[09:19] are actually using large amount of NVIDIA graphics card
[09:21] to carry out computation
[09:22] Many have tried to create
[09:23] software like CUDA
[09:25] to challenge Nvidia’s position.
[09:26] But Nvidia
[09:27] has a monopoly on hardware itself.
[09:28] They can try everything
[09:30] to merge their hardware, graphics card
[09:31] with the software, CUDA
[09:33] and make them work really well with each other
[09:33] Through hardware and software merger
[09:35] they formed a very strong moat
[09:37] Does this make you think of another company?
[09:39] That’s Apple
[09:39] They all build something
[09:41] that’s had been bandied about in business world
[09:42] an Ecosystem
[09:42] Microsoft, Adobe
[09:44] they all have their own strong ecosystem
[09:46] The amount of capital Jensen invested in CUDA
[09:48] might sound reasonable to you now
[09:50] It makes sense
[09:50] but if you look at short-term return
[09:52] It is very unreasonable.
[09:53] Wall Street is quite displeased with this thing
[09:56] because although the computation performance of GPU
[09:58] is outstanding
[09:58] but their application is not much
[10:00] For a long period of time
[10:01] it can only focus on area
[10:03] that requires massive computing
[10:04] To put it bluntly, it's not profitable at all
[10:05] Who would’ve thought that AI
[10:07] could be so popular in 2023 right
[10:09] In fact, it is not AI that first makes the
[10:11] accelerated computing capabilities of graphics cards
[10:12] realise its commercial value.
[10:14] It was a coincidence
[10:15] A trend that’s not related to AI at all
[10:16] Something that even someone like Jensen
[10:18] could not have expected
[10:22] The explosion of Bitcoin
[10:23] brought a huge demand for mining
[10:24] Mining in essence is mindless computing
[10:27] to encrypt and decrypt
[10:28] In order to do mining
[10:29] in faster way then you will need to use graphics card
[10:30] and you have to use NVIDIA’s graphics card
[10:32] I believe most of you
[10:33] only know about using graphics card to do
[10:35] computation from the mining part
[10:38] The huge demand for mining
[10:40] is like a godsend for NVIDIA
[10:42] a big big gift
[10:44] This  makes NVIDIA’s graphics card
[10:45] in constant short supply for years
[10:46] NVIDIA was very nice
[10:48] they designed a GPU specifically for mining
[10:49] Of course many would say
[10:51] Mining pollutes the environment,
[10:52] meaningless computation
[10:53] all sorts of problems
[10:54] Graphics card capability
[10:55] was seen by many
[10:57] and NVIDIA did make lots of money because of it
[11:01] According to analysts
[11:02] Between 2018 to 2021
[11:03] a period when bitcoin was very popular
[11:05] NVIDIA could earn up to
[11:06] $1 to $3 billion annually
[11:08] NVIDIA’s market cap even
[11:10] surpassed the giant
[11:12] Intel
[11:12] During the time when bitcoin was very popular
[11:13] their market cap even approached trillion dollars
[11:21] Although mining has made NVIDIA a lot of money
[11:23] but it is after all not its main business
[11:25] After the crash of crypto market
[11:26] NVIDIA’s stock plunged by 46%
[11:29] So far mining is only
[11:30] a sideshow at best
[11:31] We all know
[11:32] what’s really been helping NVIDIA lately
[11:34] Artificial Intelligence
[11:38] We mentioned that graphics card
[11:40] massive parallel computing capability
[11:41] is very suitable for deep learning and machine learning
[11:45] AI
[11:47] has to keep learning
[11:48] up to billions of times
[11:49] So GPU parallel computing capability
[11:50] is where it fits in
[11:51] Jensen Huang showed that
[11:52] to train a large language model
[11:54] in comparison with CPU
[11:54] GPU server
[11:55] can complete it at 4% of the cost
[11:57] and 1.2% of power.
[11:58] Therefore, GPU CPU
[11:59] are not on the same level
[12:00] This is determined by its underlying structure.
[12:02] Jensen Huang
[12:02] just wanted to subtly tell you that
[12:04] to train large language model
[12:06] only a fool would use CPU
[12:07] You have to use GPU
[12:08] If you use GPU, you’d better use CUDA.
[12:10] Then you have to buy the graphics card from NVIDIA
[12:13] Actually a decade ago
[12:13] no one knows graphics card can be used in AI
[12:15] AI itself
[12:16] is more theoretical than practical
[12:18] The change occurred in 2012.
[12:19] At that time, there’s a
[12:20] very famous computer competition
[12:22] called ImageNet.
[12:25] Everyone was competing
[12:25] whose algorithm could better
[12:27] recognise the content of the image
[12:28] From No.2 to No.4
[12:30] their error rate
[12:31] is about 26% to 29%.
[12:33] A team called AlexNet
[12:34] made it to 16.4%
[12:36] Ten points ahead of the second place
[12:38] and won the comepetition
[12:39] they used neural networks to train their models
[12:41] with NVIDIA’s graphics card
[12:45] We’ve talked about this in ChatGPT episode
[12:47] the theory of neural network has been around for a long time
[12:49] but it had not been realised
[12:51] the problem was with computational power
[12:52] Thanks to NVIDIA’s graphics card
[12:54] the theory of neural network has been able to realise
[12:56] It made a sensation in the academic world
[12:57] Jensen is also very serious about
[12:59] GPU’s application in AI
[13:01] They went all in after 2012
[13:03] and let NVIDIA’s graphics card
[13:04] do accelerated calculations easily and conveniently
[13:06] Apart from investment focused on CUDA
[13:07] there are also optimisation on AI for graphics card
[13:09] including software support
[13:10] platform support and etc
[13:11] Later there is a consensus in the field of AI
[13:14] If you want to do AI
[13:15] then no doubt
[13:16] you have to buy NVIDIA’s graphics card
[13:21] Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Baidu
[13:24] all used NVIDIA’s graphics card
[13:24] to train the models
[13:26] The most famous one in this wave is
[13:28] NVIDIA’s A100
[13:30] ChatGPT was trained with over 10,000 of
[13:31] graphics cards.
[13:32] A100 has also
[13:33] become the standard for training large model
[13:35] For major AI companies
[13:35] if they couldn’t come out with significant result
[13:37] but still want to catch the wave
[13:38] What do they do
[13:39] They fight in owning graphics card
[13:40] They’ll tell you
[13:41] how many NVIDIA’s
[13:42] A100 graphics card they bought
[13:43] ranging from thousands to tens of thousands
[13:44] So this caused NVIDIA’s graphics card
[13:45] to be in short supply for a long time
[13:47] Their price went up to ten of thousands of dollars
[13:49] Last year NVIDIA released
[13:50] upgraded version of A100, H100
[13:51] It has four to six times the performance of the A100
[13:56] So don’t think that
[13:57] NVIDIA is just in luck
[13:59] just because they soar the highest
[14:00] They spent a decade
[14:02] and a lot of money and effort
[14:04] to build their own wings
[14:05] Just waiting for the right wind
[14:09] Now that the wings are completed
[14:11] the wind has come
[14:12] NVIDIA definitely will want to
[14:14] fly high
[14:17] This is A100 system board released by
[14:19] Jensen Huang 3 years ago
[14:20] a big guy over 20kg
[14:21] became the world’s largest GPU
[14:24] Looks intimidating
[14:26] This year he released another thing
[14:39] DGX GH200 supercomputer.
[14:43] The size is in 1:1 ratio with the actual thing
[14:47] They use 240km of optic cable
[14:49] is kilometre
[14:49] that’s 240,000 metres
[14:51] Its weigh is equal to 4 adult elephants
[14:53] with internal memory of 144TB
[14:56] This GPU is connected using
[14:59] technology like NVLink, NVSwitch
[15:01] And these 4 elephants
[15:02] is actually a mega graphics card
[15:08] it is specifically used for AI computation
[15:09] It's expected to be ready by the end of the year
[15:11] Google Cloud, Meta, Microsoft
[15:13] are the first to access it
[15:14] With such big first-mover advantage
[15:15] NVIDIA is not limited to making
[15:17] only graphics card and chip design
[15:18] In 2019, they spent $6.9 billion
[15:20] to acquire an Israeli chip company
[15:22] called Mellanox
[15:22] and came up with something called DPU
[15:24] This thing is very powerful too
[15:25] Jensen Huang said that
[15:26] this acquisition is the most
[15:28] successful strategic decision he has ever made
[15:29] NVIDIA has started to merge
[15:31] GPU, CPU and DPU together
[15:33] and created
[15:33] a server with incredible computing power
[15:35] Supercomputer
[15:36] is slowly creeping towards CPU market
[15:38] and launched a variety of products
[15:39] The eighth supercomputer in the world
[15:41] DGX BasePOD
[15:42] Accelerated superchip
[15:43] GPU Grace Hopper
[15:44] computing platform
[15:44] BlueField-3 DPU and so on
[15:46] Good names right
[15:47] but you probably don’t understand
[15:50] In short, Nvidia
[15:52] covers everything
[15:53] from chips to supercomputers
[15:55] they’ve got it all covered
[15:55] What if you can’t afford it
[15:57] or don’t want to buy so many hardware?
[15:58] It’s okay
[15:59] NVIDIA can lease it to you
[16:01] just get connected online
[16:01] and use NVIDIA’s server
[16:03] This is AI cloud business
[16:08] It provides services to end user
[16:10] as well as upstream companies
[16:11] They came up with a software called cuLitho
[16:13] to help TSMC, ASML
[16:14] these upstream chip makers
[16:16] Improve the performance of Inverse lithography technology by up to 40 times
[16:18] By the way,
[16:19] I have a Spanish friend who told me
[16:21] that the name cuLitho
[16:22] in Spanish sounds like
[16:23] a booty
[16:28] One word
[16:29] Incredible
[16:31] See, NVIDIA expanding across hardware,
[16:34] software, services and etc
[16:36] becoming the biggest winner in this AI wave
[16:41] US sanctions towards China
[16:43] bans the sale of A100  and H100
[16:44] to China.
[16:45] The impact on Nvidia is actually quite big.
[16:46] China occupies a quarter of
[16:47] NVIDIA market
[16:49] They don’t want the cake
[16:50] fly away just because of US government
[16:52] When a reporter interviewed
[16:53] Jensen Huang asking him
[16:55] how big is the impact of this for NVIDIA
[16:56] His answer is impermeable
[16:59] First we will definitely work closely
[17:00] with US government’s policy
[17:01] Express their position first
[17:02] At the same time we are trying
[17:04] within the rules
[17:05] to satisfy the demand
[17:07] of Chinese consumers
[17:10] He offends neither side
[17:10] NVIDIA released
[17:12] A800 graphics card
[17:13] bypass a bunch of sensitive technology that has been sanctioned
[17:15] This is made especially just for China
[17:16] Alright
[17:17] we understand the entire background of Nvidia,
[17:19] it’s very clear now when you look at their earnings report
[17:21] Currently they divided their business into 4 segments
[17:23] Gaming, data centre
[17:24] automotive, professional graphics processing
[17:26] Previously NVIDIA’s ace business was gaming
[17:28] and data center is about accelerated computing
[17:31] lAI, Cloud service and etc
[17:32] are all in this segment
[17:33] These two segments are the main ones
[17:34] In 2018,
[17:35] Gaming occupied half of their business
[17:37] Data center is a quarter
[17:38] by 2022,
[17:39] Data center occupies 56% of their business
[17:41] Gaming dropped to 33%
[17:43] The earning report released on 24th May
[17:45] their revenue dropped significantly due
[17:47] to sluggish global demand in gaming
[17:48] This is actually what Wall Street expected.
[17:50] However data center segment
[17:51] is strong
[17:52] 18% growth from previous quarter
[17:54] Most importantly the revenue in second quarter
[17:55] blinded Wall Street
[17:58] Wall Street predicted that
[17:59] their revenue for Q2 would be $7.2 billion
[18:01] but NVIDIA came out and said
[18:02] Your estimation is incorrect
[18:03] Our revenue is $11 billion, 50% more
[18:06] For automotive segment
[18:08] it is a segment with great potential
[18:09] Not only have to do chip for cars
[18:11] also need to create car system
[18:11] Another big cake
[18:13] But this is at initial stage
[18:15] It’s difficult to say what’s going to happen in future
[18:16] So we’ll not discuss it
[18:17] Before this NVIDIA released Omniverse
[18:19] to bet on Metaverse
[18:20] Although we haven’t seen much return yet
[18:22] but I’ve watched the promotional video
[18:23] It really is quite cool
[18:24] If Metaverse ushered in explosive period
[18:26] Then NVIDIA will again be on of the biggest winner
[18:28] It’s definite
[18:31] Anyway, the general picture is that
[18:33] gaming needs graphics card
[18:34] mining needs graphics card
[18:35] AI computing needs graphics card
[18:37] Need graphics card look for NVIDIA
[18:40] NVIDIA stock price
[18:40] rose by over 1000 fold
[18:42] from its initial IPO
[18:43] becoming the sixth largest company in the world
[18:45] And it looks like it's just getting started
[18:56] From the stories earlier
[18:58] you would’ve believe Jensen is almost godlike
[18:59] Every step is so precise.
[19:01] but he actually made a lot of mistakes along the way
[19:02] For the continuity of the story
[19:04] I ignored it
[19:04] In the early 2000s
[19:06] There was a series of graphics card failures
[19:07] almost defeated by ATI
[19:08] there were also insider trading committed by employees
[19:09] SEC did a thorough investigation on them
[19:11] There was also problem with over-marketing
[19:12] They even tried to enter mobile phone chip market
[19:14] but it was all a failure
[19:15] Looking at their stock price
[19:17] Although it has risen so much as a whole
[19:18] but in 2002 it dropped by 90%
[19:20] 2008 dropped 80%
[19:21] with more than 50% of retracement
[19:23] This occurs every 3 to 5 years
[19:24] Everyone knows
[19:26] Jensen is great
[19:27] but he is no fortune-teller
[19:28] His obsession with leather jacket
[19:30] I don’t know what else to say
[19:33] Alright
[19:34] Let’s talk a little bit about NVIDIA’s stock price
[19:36] I’m worried that many would rush
[19:37] to buy
[19:38] NVIDIA’s stock after this video
[19:39] I wouldn’t say you cannot buy
[19:40] but just don’t go buy it
[19:42] on a whim
[19:43] The estimated value for NVIDIA
[19:44] is too high from every perspectives
[19:46] Their Price to Earning ratio is over 200
[19:47] Price to Sales ratio is 38
[19:48] For Apple, Microsoft and Google
[19:50] their Price to Earning is less than 40
[19:51] Tesla is only over 70
[19:52] Compare them with those in same industry
[19:53] Their revenue
[19:55] is less than half of Intel’s
[19:56] but market cap is 7 times more than Intel
[19:59] revenue is similar to AMD
[20:00] but market cap is 5 times more than AMD
[20:02] One word
[20:03] Expensive
[20:04] Of course they are expensive for a reason
[20:05] For a company in an industry like this
[20:06] moreover it’s a monopolistic company
[20:07] Its valuation is no longer one of the
[20:10] main criteria for judging stock price
[20:10] One of the main reason
[20:12] do you know what it is?
[20:12] There are some professional institutions
[20:14] dare not to not invest in NVIDIA
[20:16] because AI is the biggest wave
[20:17] with biggest opportunity in the market
[20:18] And NVIDIA is the biggest player
[20:20] in this AI wave
[20:21] When these funds invested in NVIDIA
[20:22] even if the stock price fall
[20:23] investors wouldn’t complain much
[20:25] but if NVIDIA stock price keeps rising
[20:27] and they didn’t invest because the price is expensive
[20:29] then investors would really be pissed
[20:32] Cathie Wood
[20:34] liquidated NVIDIA stocks
[20:36] in January through her ETF
[20:37] Lately NVIDIA stock price is rising
[20:38] she was reviled in the
[20:40] investment circle
[20:41] Choosing to not invest in this type of company
[20:42] would risk fund their reputation
[20:45] There’s a term in English
[20:45] that best describe this behaviour
[20:47] It is FoMO
[20:48] Fear of Missing Out
[20:50] They fear losing the potential rise
[20:52] more than buying at expensive price
[20:54] This is similar to Tesla two years ago
[20:56] EV has great future
[20:57] and Tesla was
[20:59] the only option
[21:00] even if its valuation
[21:01] is astronomical compare to
[21:02] other automotive companies
[21:03] but funds still continued to buy
[21:05] The behaviour of FoMo
[21:07] in turn pushes the stock price
[21:08] of these companies to an even higher position
[21:09] You can say that
[21:10] for these type of companies
[21:11] they just have huge risk premium
[21:13] but just because of this
[21:14] you can’t say that their stock price is too high
[21:16] That's not necessarily true
[21:16] Because it they can sustain this momentum
[21:18] and maintain this development trend
[21:19] Then their stock price will continue to rise
[21:22] There's a metaphor that many people often use
[21:24] The wave we mentioned
[21:25] is similar to gold rush
[21:27] It’s hard to bet where the gold is
[21:28] or who will find the gold
[21:30] but there is a sure-fire deal
[21:31] and that is you can sell shovels
[21:32] Nvidia
[21:33] is like selling a shovel at digital age
[21:35] at AI age
[21:36] This metaphor sounds right
[21:37] and quite reasonable
[21:39] But whenever I hear this analogy
[21:40] it doesn’t seems right
[21:42] Those who understand economy would know that
[21:43] if you sell shovel during gold rush
[21:46] could you be making a fortune?
[21:47] The first one would perhaps earn a little
[21:49] but if more people are selling it
[21:50] and it’s easy to make shovel
[21:51] then the marginal profit would quickly be eaten up
[21:53] so in most industries
[21:54] if you sell this so-called shovel
[21:55] the upstream production tool
[21:57] Due to its low entry barrier
[21:58] the competition in the industry will be very fierce
[22:00] so the profit margin will be low
[22:02] However for NVIDIA
[22:03] they can achieve a monopoly and a market value
[22:05] of trillions by doing this so-called shovel
[22:06] Its similar to TSMC
[22:08] more basic than shovel, they make hammer
[22:10] a tool to make shovel
[22:11] And they can monopolise that
[22:12] Have you ever thought why?
[22:15] We’ll get deep into the
[22:17] feature of chip industry
[22:18] Have you heard of Moore’s Law?
[22:21] On an integrated circuit
[22:23] the number of transistors that can be accommodated
[22:24] double up every 18 months
[22:26] You can understand it as
[22:27] The speed of chip can be faster every 18 months
[22:29] Actually for the past few years
[22:30] The speed of CPU evolution
[22:31] is difficult to catch up with Moore’s law
[22:33] However Jensen found that
[22:34] the advancement of GPU dedicated graphics card
[22:37] is faster than prediction of Moore’s Law
[22:39] Performance increase more than triples every 2 years
[22:41] This pattern even has
[22:42] its own term
[22:43] Huang's Law
[22:48] No matter which law it is
[22:49] This is a distinctive feature
[22:49] in chip industry
[22:51] The initial cost to invest is very high
[22:53] and requires a lot of talents and equipment
[22:54] The problem is that
[22:55] the iteration rate is too fast
[22:57] This is an industry that is constantly running
[23:01] the iteration rate of this industry is too fast
[23:03] From business perspective
[23:05] this pose a tricky problem
[23:06] it’s difficult for company to build their own moat
[23:08] Moat is very important
[23:10] to a company
[23:11] For a traditional company
[23:11] if they spent a lot of money to build a factory, a railroad
[23:13] then they have large-scale advantage
[23:15] and cost advantage
[23:15] These advantages work as a moat
[23:17] This moat will protect the company for a long time
[23:19] The moat of internet company is stronger
[23:20] Once a network effect is established
[23:22] Wechat, Tiktok, Facebook
[23:23] users are your strong moat.
[23:27] For chip industry
[23:28] there are Moore’s Law, Huang’s Law
[23:30] No matter how good of a chip you release today
[23:32] it’ll be outdated in two years
[23:34] You won’t know who’ll make it next year
[23:35] and take you down with his new technology
[23:37] In the 90s
[23:38] during the graphics card war
[23:40] A company established less than two years
[23:41] 3DFX
[23:42] quickly became the industry standard
[23:44] with their Voodoo graphics card
[23:45] 5 years later they became dreary
[23:46] and was acquired by NVIDIA
[23:47] This is because their moat
[23:49] hasn’t finished building and was destroyed
[23:50] In this industry, it’s difficult to rely on a single product
[23:52] or a single technology
[23:54] to form a moat that lasts more than 2 years
[23:55] Of course you can slowly accumulate many patents
[23:57] to defend yourself
[23:58] but the truth is
[24:00] people will always find a way
[24:01] to get around those patents
[24:02] it doesn’t provide much protection
[24:04] You have to keep running
[24:06] and run faster than everyone
[24:08] This running ability is your moat
[24:10] In chip industry
[24:11] the moat is R&D
[24:12] You have to develop a complete set of
[24:14] talents, facilities, organisation structure
[24:16] These form the moat for chip company
[24:20] This is why R&D is expensive
[24:21] First is the initial cost is very high
[24:23] requires a lot of talents
[24:24] most importantly you have to continuously
[24:26] keep the iteration and running speed high
[24:27] Not a lot of people can stand it
[24:29] Those tech giants are
[24:30] actually very focused on technological innovation
[24:32] Amazon, Google, Microsoft
[24:34] their R&D investment is 10% to 15%
[24:35] of their revenue
[24:36] For NVIDIA
[24:37] they have to keep invest around
[24:38] 25% of their revenue for R&D
[24:41] The Huang’s Law
[24:42] is not a natural phenomenon
[24:44] It is the result of
[24:45] a rat race he created
[24:47] If we were to tell a story
[24:48] we can say NVIDIA
[24:48] has been monopolising graphics card market since 2006
[24:50] end in just one sentence
[24:51] However for many times
[24:52] they overturned
[24:53] their own framework and technology
[24:55] They pushed themselves to release
[24:56] new generation of chip every 6 months
[24:58] For example their latest ray tracing RTX technology
[25:01] completely overturned
[25:02] the program accumulated before
[25:03] They use deep learning method
[25:04] through 1 pixel
[25:05] they guess what the other 8 pixels surround it looks like
[25:08] to speed up image processing.
[25:08] This intense running speed
[25:10] makes only those who run fastest
[25:12] with largest pool of talent
[25:13] and wealthiest companies
[25:15] can make money.
[25:16] The rest could only run behind
[25:17] This is why we often see that
[25:19] after a war in chip industry
[25:20] it always ends in acquisition
[25:21] It's not just the difficulty of developing chips
[25:24] it’s mainly because it’s not economical
[25:25] Even those tech giants
[25:26] with plentiful talents
[25:27] won't set foot in the chip industry
[25:28] unless they are forced to
[25:30] But things are different now
[25:32] The AI field is one of the biggest possible
[25:33] battleground for the tech giants
[25:35] In this battle, graphics card is too important
[25:37] after all it determines computing speed
[25:38] Non of them wish to be
[25:40] strangled by NVIDIA
[25:41] during AI era right
[25:44] Although currently they are
[25:45] NVIDIA’s biggest customer
[25:46] but at the same time they delve into
[25:48] R&D and chip making in full swing
[25:50] Google already developed a chip
[25:51] specifically designed for AI training called TPU
[25:54] According to them,
[25:54] it is more efficient than Nvidia's graphics card.
[25:56] In 2017, Meta already used
[25:58] over 20,000 NVIDIA's graphics cards
[26:00] for AI training
[26:01] but now they are also
[26:02] all in in researching chip, calling it MTIA
[26:05] Actually from 2020
[26:06] NVIDIA has been actively seeking
[26:08] Masayoshi Son’s Softbank
[26:09] to acquire their chip company ARM
[26:11] at the price of $40 billion
[26:13] But Qualcomm, Microsoft and Google
[26:15] are all strongly against it
[26:17] The deal fell through
[26:18] From here you can see that those tech giants
[26:19] are actually very afraid of Nvidia.
[26:24] Emerging from the early days graphics card industry
[26:27] is his ability
[26:28] Having laid out CUDA since 20 years ago
[26:31] is his vision
[26:32] Continuous monopoly in graphics card industry
[26:34] is his endurance
[26:35] Meeting the demand for massive computing power in mining
[26:37] is his luck
[26:39] The unchanged fashion style
[26:41] is his devotion
[26:45] When long accumulation period
[26:47] meets the AI wave
[26:48] NVIDIA naturally obtain
[26:49] first-mover advantage
[26:51] Facing new vast potential market
[26:53] and competitors looking to get in on the action
[26:55] Can NVIDIA fight their
[26:56] way out again in this
[26:58] new wave of AI fight?
[26:59] It’s hard to say
