[00:00] There are quite literally thousands of
[00:02] AI tools on the market right now. And
[00:04] because my work revolves around helping
[00:06] businesses use AI, I've tested pretty
[00:08] much all of them. A lot of them probably
[00:10] aren't worth your time or money, but
[00:12] there's a few amazing ones that can save
[00:14] you dozens of hours every week, and some
[00:16] might even revolutionize how you work.
[00:18] So today, I'm going to share what I
[00:20] believe to be the best AI tools that you
[00:22] can use to do everything from boosting
[00:23] your personal productivity to building
[00:25] powerful AI automations all the way to
[00:28] transforming your entire business
[00:30] operations. All right, starting with
[00:31] Whisper Flow. This is a voicetoext AI
[00:34] tool that works in any app where you
[00:35] need to type something. Rather than
[00:37] typing with your keyboard, simply hold
[00:38] down the whisper hotkey, start talking,
[00:40] and it does the typing for you. But it
[00:42] doesn't just transcribe what you're
[00:44] saying word for word. It actually uses
[00:45] AI to understand what you're trying to
[00:47] say. and then spits out text with
[00:49] perfect grammar, punctuation, and with a
[00:51] clear, logical flow. This has been such
[00:53] a productivity hack for me. I'm using it
[00:55] for everything from writing emails,
[00:57] Slack messages, but most of all, I use
[00:59] it from where I'm prompting AI tools. I
[01:01] just basically hold down the hotkey,
[01:03] start talking, I ramble for 2 minutes,
[01:05] telling the AI roughly what I want it to
[01:07] do, and then whisper spits out a clear
[01:09] and well structured prompt. Speaking of
[01:11] voice tech getting crazy, 11 Labs has
[01:13] basically perfected voice cloning. All
[01:15] you need to do is upload around 30
[01:17] minutes of audio of you talking and then
[01:19] boom, there is an AI version of your
[01:21] voice that sounds exactly like you. Not
[01:23] only your voice, but how you pause, how
[01:25] you emphasize words, even those little
[01:27] quirks in how you talk. People are using
[01:29] it to create entire video courses,
[01:31] automating customer calls, or making
[01:34] audio books, all without recording
[01:35] anything themselves. It's kind of
[01:37] unsettling how good it actually is. And
[01:39] while we're on the topic of voice,
[01:41] chatbt voice mode in their mobile app
[01:43] has become my go-to companion for
[01:45] brainstorming. It's not the way that
[01:46] you'd normally use chatbt, typing
[01:49] prompts and waiting for a response, but
[01:50] actually having a full conversation with
[01:52] it. Hi, ChatBT. How are you?
[01:54] Hey there, I'm doing great. Thanks for
[01:56] asking. Always happy to chat with you.
[01:58] How about you?
[01:59] You can talk through business
[02:00] strategies, get feedback on ideas, or
[02:02] work through any problems while you're
[02:04] walking or on the go. And the real super
[02:06] hack is after you've had a long
[02:08] conversation back and forth with chat
[02:09] GBT on a certain topic, ask it to
[02:11] summarize everything you discussed in a
[02:13] well ststructured document. This is then
[02:15] super handy if you're working on a new
[02:17] project plan. You discuss it back and
[02:19] forth with chatbt and at the end you
[02:20] have this perfect document that you can
[02:22] share with your team. For writing,
[02:23] Claude has become my secret weapon,
[02:25] specifically Claude projects. Think of
[02:27] it like creating your own team of
[02:28] specialized AI copywriters. Here's how
[02:30] it works. You create different projects
[02:32] for different types of writing. So, I
[02:33] have one for writing LinkedIn posts,
[02:35] another one for the AI tutorials on our
[02:37] website, and another one for writing
[02:38] YouTube scripts. You just upload
[02:40] examples of your best work, give it
[02:42] specific instructions, and now every
[02:44] time you use that project, it writes
[02:45] exactly the way you want it to. For my
[02:47] YouTube script writing project, I
[02:49] literally uploaded the transcript from a
[02:50] 2hour YouTube script writing course, and
[02:53] now I just tell it my video idea, and it
[02:55] writes the script following all of those
[02:56] best practices. Claude is honestly the
[02:59] best AI writer out there. The copy
[03:00] sounds like me because it learned from
[03:02] my examples. If you use Notion, then you
[03:04] need to be using Notion AI. It is built
[03:06] right in and actually understands your
[03:08] entire workspace. To activate it, you
[03:10] just need to hit the space bar on any
[03:12] new line and then it springs to life. If
[03:14] you need meeting notes summarized, if
[03:15] you need action items pulled out, if you
[03:17] need to write a proposal, notion AI
[03:19] knows your exact company's format
[03:21] because it can reference it from other
[03:23] pages. It can even search through
[03:24] connected Slack and Google Drive. The
[03:27] coolest part is AI blocks. Save prompts
[03:29] that you use all the time and reuse them
[03:31] across pages. Your whole team can use
[03:33] the same AI command. It's like having an
[03:35] AI assistant that actually knows how
[03:37] your company works. When it comes to AI
[03:40] generated images, Google recently
[03:41] dropped what might be the best image
[03:43] editing AI ever. It's called Nano
[03:45] Banana, also known as Gemini 2.5 Flash
[03:48] Image. You can completely change
[03:50] someone's outfit, put them in a
[03:51] different location, blend multiple
[03:53] photos together, and they still look
[03:54] like themselves. No weird AI face stuff
[03:57] or six finger hands. And it is fast,
[04:00] like 1 to two seconds per image instead
[04:02] of the 10 to 15 that we're seeing in
[04:03] other tools. Right now, it's free to use
[04:05] in Gemini. You get 100 edits per day.
[04:08] Before we get into the next tool, if
[04:09] you're finding these tools valuable,
[04:11] we're actually launching a free AI
[04:12] starter course that shows you the
[04:14] complete AI tools landscape and more
[04:16] importantly, how to actually implement
[04:18] them in your workflow. Lesson two
[04:20] specifically breaks down every category
[04:22] of AI tools and when to use each one.
[04:24] It's completely free to enroll. The link
[04:26] is in the description. Just look for AI
[04:28] starter course. Now, let's move into the
[04:30] tools that can help you build with AI.
[04:32] Starting with what I'd call integration
[04:34] or automation platforms. While you can
[04:36] already get a ton of value from chatting
[04:38] with chatbt, Gemini, or Claude, the real
[04:40] power comes when you bring AI into your
[04:43] automated business processes. And the
[04:45] traditional automation platforms, Zapia,
[04:47] MG, and NAND have gotten really good at
[04:50] this. They allow you to not only build
[04:51] AI automations, but also AI agents.
[04:54] Zappia is probably the most beginner
[04:56] friendly. You simply need to drag and
[04:57] drop to connect thousands of apps with
[05:00] AI. Customer email comes in, AI analyzes
[05:03] it, updates your CRM, creates follow-up
[05:05] tasks, all automatically with no coding
[05:08] needed. Make.com. This is for when you
[05:10] need more complex stuff, but it's still
[05:11] very beginnerfriendly. You can see
[05:13] exactly how your data flows through the
[05:15] automation. Perfect if you're building
[05:17] for clients. Plus, their new make grid
[05:19] feature shows you a visual map of how
[05:21] all the systems and automations in your
[05:23] company connect. It's honestly gorgeous.
[05:26] For the more techsavvy folks, N8N gives
[05:28] you the most flexibility with its
[05:30] open-source approach. With N8N, you can
[05:32] create sophisticated AI agent workflows
[05:34] and self-host for complete control over
[05:36] your data. But there's a new breed of
[05:38] integration platforms that have been
[05:40] designed specifically with AI in mind.
[05:42] And two that are absolutely worth
[05:44] checking out are Relay.app and Gumloop.
[05:47] Both are great platforms that have made
[05:48] it very simple for beginners to start
[05:50] building their first AI automations. But
[05:52] what I really want to highlight is that
[05:54] both founders, Jacob from Relay and Max
[05:57] from Gum Loop, are constantly sharing
[05:59] real use cases and templates that
[06:01] actually work. So if you're learning AI
[06:03] automation, definitely follow these
[06:04] guys. They're dropping gold daily. Now,
[06:07] when you start using AI inside
[06:09] automations, you quickly realize that
[06:10] nailing your prompts becomes more
[06:12] important than ever. This is where the
[06:14] anthropic prompt generator comes in.
[06:16] It's a tool that I use so I never have
[06:18] to write a prompt from scratch. All you
[06:20] need to do is give it a highlevel one or
[06:22] two sentence description of what you're
[06:24] trying to accomplish, even a scrappy
[06:25] basic prompt, and it converts it into a
[06:27] prompt that follows all the best
[06:29] practices. It adds proper formatting,
[06:31] includes placeholders for variables, and
[06:33] structures the output so that you can
[06:35] actually use AI's results in other steps
[06:37] of your automation. Put simply, if
[06:39] you're building AI automations, then you
[06:41] should be using this tool. Something
[06:42] else that is super useful for AI
[06:44] automations and agents is giving AI the
[06:47] ability to search and read websites.
[06:49] Firecrawl makes any website readable for
[06:52] AI. It takes messy web pages and turns
[06:54] them into clean data that AI can
[06:56] actually understand. Single pages,
[06:58] entire websites, search results. Fire
[07:01] Crow handles all the annoying stuff like
[07:02] cookie banners, JavaScript, and avoiding
[07:04] detection. You can tell it exactly what
[07:06] information to extract and how to format
[07:08] it. Perfect for competitive intelligence
[07:10] or content pipelines. Moving on from the
[07:13] automation platforms and now let's look
[07:15] at the dedicated AI agent builders. And
[07:17] there's two that I want to recommend. If
[07:19] you're not so technical but want to
[07:21] build AI agents, start with Lindy.
[07:24] Lindy.ai. The new Lindy 3.0 agent
[07:27] builder is insane. Just describe what
[07:29] you want in plain English and it builds
[07:31] the whole agent in minutes. They also
[07:33] have computer mode where your agent can
[07:34] actually click through websites and apps
[07:36] like a human. plus built-in meeting
[07:38] recording so your AI agents can join
[07:40] your meetings. The interface is super
[07:43] clean and you can see exactly what your
[07:45] agent is doing. For more advanced stuff,
[07:47] Relevance AI lets you build seriously
[07:49] powerful custom AI agents. But you're
[07:51] not just building agents, you're also
[07:53] creating the tools the agent uses. Their
[07:55] new workforce feature lets you build
[07:57] entire teams or swarms of AI agents that
[08:00] actually work together. Like one agent
[08:02] finds the leads, passes them to another
[08:04] agent that does the research, and then
[08:06] hands off to a third that writes
[08:08] personalized messages. It's not just
[08:10] single agents anymore. It's an entire AI
[08:12] agent department working together.
[08:14] They've got LinkedIn automation, website
[08:16] scraping. Basically, everything a human
[08:18] can do in a browser, your agents can do
[08:20] automatically, and you have total
[08:22] control over the details. Google AI
[08:24] Studio is basically your playground for
[08:26] all of Gemini's features, and it's
[08:28] completely free. The real magic is in
[08:30] the build section. And you literally
[08:32] just type what kind of app you want and
[08:34] it creates a full AI web application.
[08:36] I'm talking an actual functional app
[08:38] with interfaces, logic, everything. You
[08:41] want a document analyzer, a recipe
[08:43] generator based on fridge photos. Just
[08:45] describe it and you have a working app
[08:46] in seconds. All the Gemini APIs are
[08:49] built in. You don't need an API key. You
[08:51] don't need any setup or any billing. You
[08:53] can just start building. You can test
[08:55] every Gemini model, try different
[08:57] settings, and see what works best for
[08:59] your use case. Then when you're ready,
[09:01] export the code or just share the app
[09:03] directly. Google have basically given
[09:05] everyone a free AI development studio,
[09:07] but not enough people know about it. If
[09:09] you want to experiment with AI apps
[09:11] without any technical hassle, this is
[09:13] definitely where you start. There's also
[09:14] another category of AI agents, and
[09:16] that's browser agents. Airtop lets you
[09:18] build powerful browser agents that lets
[09:20] you automate the web just with your
[09:22] words. This is especially useful if
[09:24] you're trying to interact with a tool
[09:25] that doesn't have an API and you need to
[09:27] use a website like a human would. Just
[09:29] tell your browser agent what you want it
[09:31] to do in plain English, like go through
[09:33] this directory and grab all the contact
[09:35] info. It'll then navigate through
[09:36] hundreds of pages, handle the login,
[09:39] compile everything into a spreadsheet,
[09:40] all with absolutely zero coding
[09:42] whatsoever. Last one for building with
[09:45] AI. Zite is the ultimate vibe no coding
[09:48] tool that lets you create real business
[09:49] apps without any coding. The AI will
[09:52] help design your layout, suggest
[09:53] improvements, and can generate complete
[09:55] interfaces based on your data and what
[09:57] you describe. It's great for client
[09:59] portals, dashboards, data collection
[10:01] apps. It connects and builds right on
[10:03] top of your existing tools like Google
[10:05] Sheets and Air Table. And you can
[10:06] publish on custom domains and embed your
[10:08] apps anywhere. Now for the heavy hitters
[10:11] that transform entire businesses with
[10:13] AI, starting with Air Table, Air Table
[10:16] just made AI stupid simple for business
[10:18] workflows. Create columns that
[10:20] automatically summarize and categorize
[10:22] data. Add AI steps to workflows that
[10:24] enrich leads or generate content in
[10:26] seconds. But the killer feature, it can
[10:28] read PDFs and documents and
[10:30] automatically put the data in the right
[10:32] columns. The new Omni AI app builder is
[10:34] pretty nuts. You just describe what you
[10:36] want and it builds the complete business
[10:37] app for you with databases, interfaces,
[10:40] and automations. Stuff only developers
[10:42] could do before. Now, here's something
[10:43] that's absolutely critical in the AI
[10:46] era, especially for businesses. Call
[10:48] transcripts. Every single person should
[10:50] be recording their meetings. And the one
[10:52] that I'm currently using is CircleBack.
[10:54] This tool automatically transcribes your
[10:56] meetings across Zoom, Google Meet,
[10:58] Teams, or even in-person conversations,
[11:00] and it generates incredibly detailed
[11:02] notes that are organized by topic with
[11:04] action items automatically assigned to
[11:06] each participant. It also has an AI
[11:09] powered search across all your meetings.
[11:11] So, you can literally ask it questions
[11:12] like, "What did we decide about our
[11:14] product roadmap last month?" And it will
[11:15] find the exact moment and give you the
[11:17] relevant context. It's pretty clear that
[11:19] every business needs a CRM and ATIO is
[11:22] an AI native CRM built with AI in mind.
[11:25] You can deploy AI directly in your CRM
[11:28] setting up research agents to tackle
[11:30] complex tasks like prospecting and lead
[11:32] routing. It's also super fast to set up.
[11:34] You just sync your email and calendar
[11:36] and ATIO starts tracking everything and
[11:38] populates your CRM before your eyes.
[11:40] They also have built-in call
[11:41] intelligence for AI to automatically
[11:43] capture and store insights from any of
[11:45] your sales calls. While we're on the
[11:47] topic of sales, Clay is the go-to tool
[11:49] for scaling sales outreach. They
[11:51] basically invented the job position GTM
[11:54] Engineer. Clay is like a spreadsheet on
[11:56] steroids for finding and enriching
[11:58] prospects. You just import a list of
[12:00] companies or people, and Clay
[12:02] automatically enriches it with data from
[12:03] over a 100 different sources. And the AI
[12:06] agent feature, which has by far the best
[12:08] name, Clay Agent, can visit any website
[12:11] and pull specific information you need,
[12:13] like find the tech stack this company
[12:15] uses or check if they're hiring for
[12:17] sales roles. It'll actually go and
[12:18] browse their site and bring back the
[12:20] answer. Then you can use all of that
[12:22] research to write hyperpersonalized
[12:23] outreach that actually works. Cassidy.ai
[12:26] lets you build AI assistants that
[12:28] actually know your business. Not generic
[12:30] chat bots, but specialized assistance
[12:32] for each department. You can create a
[12:34] customer support bot that knows all of
[12:36] your products, a sales assistant that
[12:38] understands your pipeline. The knowledge
[12:40] base syncs with all your tools so that
[12:42] the AI always has the current info.
[12:44] Companies are using this to automate RFP
[12:46] responses, support tickets, competitive
[12:48] analysis, anything that requires deep
[12:50] knowledge of your own business data.
[12:53] Last one, super.work. Super solves that
[12:55] annoying problem of information
[12:57] scattered everywhere. You know, when
[12:58] you're hunting through Slack, Drive,
[13:00] Notion, and 10 other apps for that one
[13:02] thing. Super's AI searches everything at
[13:04] once and you just ask it what you need
[13:06] like what did we decide on pricing or
[13:08] get me the latest on project X and it
[13:10] finds it instantly across all your
[13:12] tools. The security is perfect too. Each
[13:14] member of your team will only get
[13:16] answers based on what they actually have
[13:18] access to. So there's no accidental
[13:20] surfacing of confidential stuff. It's
[13:21] like having a perfect memory of
[13:23] everything that ever happened at your
[13:25] company. Now there's one more amazing
[13:27] tool that's just come out recently and
[13:28] that is Chat GBT agent mode. And with so
[13:31] many ways to use it, I couldn't do it
[13:33] justice in a video like this. So, click
[13:35] here to head over to the next video
[13:37] where I go over eight of the most insane
[13:39] use cases for chat GBT agents that you
[13:42] can use either in your day-to-day work
[13:44] life, in any startup, or small to medium
[13:46] business. See you over there.
