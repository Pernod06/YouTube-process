[00:00] [upbeat music]
[00:13] - Hi, my name's Jeff. I'm a bartender at Dutch
Kills in New York City and today, I'm gonna show you
[00:23] how to mix every cocktail. And by every cocktail, we
mean not every cocktail because that would be insane.
[00:28] Today, we're gonna focus
on classic cocktails. These are the drinks from the
19th and early 20th century
[00:33] that are still popular today. These are the basic tools I
use when I'm mixing drinks. Boston shaker.
[00:39] I use them because it gives
me a little bit more control. They're easier to open and
then you get a frothier drink at the end.
[00:44] Strainers. This is a Hawthorne strainer. This is a julep strainer. This is a fine mesh strainer.
[00:50] We like to use it for straining
out finer shards of ice so you get a really nice, smooth
shaken cocktail at the end.
[00:55] Bar spoon. You need these for stirring
your stirred drinks. Also, the bar spoon
itself is a measurement
[01:01] for small portions. Jiggers. The bartender's measuring cup. This is your muddler.
[01:06] Necessary for mashing to
get essential oils out or to dissolve sugar into a
drink like an Old Fashioned.
[01:12] I can't stress this enough, good ice is extremely important
for making a good cocktail. You can have great quality alcohol,
[01:19] beautiful, fresh juices and then you put a piece of
smelly ice from your freezer into a drink and it's just going
to taste like your freezer.
[01:27] So what I recommend is
to pick up a bag of ice from a grocery store
before you're making drinks
[01:33] to make nicer ice in a
silicone mold at home, or, if you live in a major
city, there's a ice company
[01:39] in most places that'll
be happy to furnish you with big, dense cubes like this. [suspenseful music]
[01:46] Old fashioned. To make an old fashioned, we're
gonna build it in the glass. First, we start with a white sugar cube.
[01:53] Three to four good dashes of bitters. Just a small drop of soda
water to help the bitters
[01:59] and sugar cube dissolve when we muddle it.
[02:04] Whiskey, could be bourbon or rye. I think the most traditional is bourbon and it's what I'm using for this.
[02:11] Ice. For an Old Fashioned, I like
to use as big of a piece as ice as possible to fit in the glass,
[02:16] reduce the surface area between the ice and the rest of the drink. So we're slowing down
the melting of the ice
[02:22] and we can hold on to
our drink for longer. And lower that in with the bar spoon so that we don't splash everywhere.
[02:28] You don't really wanna
over-stir an Old Fashioned. And traditionally, this
gets the rabid ears garnish, which is a orange and lemon twist.
[02:36] So I like to express all the
essential oils outta that twist and crisscross.
[02:42] This is the Old Fashioned, the
classic of classic cocktails. When the word "cocktail" first came about,
[02:47] it was really just defined as "spirit with water, sugar and bitters." And those are the primary
ingredients in the drink.
[02:55] Manhattan. First thing you'll need
is a chilled pint glass.
[03:00] Bitters in. One ounce sweet vermouth
to two ounces rye whiskey. And as always, we're adding
all of our spirits before ice,
[03:09] starting with the least
expensive ingredient first. You can use any blunt object to crack ice. I'm using the back of a
steel muddler, in this case.
[03:16] For great control, you can
even just use a tablespoon from your kitchen. And now we stir. This actually will take a second.
[03:22] You can sing a song in your head. That's something I like to do. Quick taste and temperature check.
[03:30] It's getting cold. Chilled coupe. Again, every ingredient
should be as cold as possible to keep your drink as
cold as long as possible.
[03:37] This is a Luxardo Cherry. The kind of bright red
maraschino cherries you see in a lot of bars were based on this.
[03:44] Really, really tasty. Highly recommend finding them if you can. For stir drinks, I'll use a julep strainer
[03:49] because it fits better
into the pint glass. This is a Manhattan. Legend has it, it was developed
at the famous Manhattan club
[03:56] in the 1870s. It's the, probably, second
most popular cocktail, right after the Old Fashioned.
[04:01] Still to this day. Whiskey Sour. To make a Whiskey Sour,
we need fresh lemon juice.
[04:07] It's probably the single,
quickest, easiest thing you can do to improve the
quality of your drinks is using fresh juice whenever possible.
[04:13] The simple syrup is equal
parts regular white sugar and water dissolved, and
two ounces of whiskey.
[04:19] So what makes this Whiskey Sour
traditional is the addition of egg white for a foamy top.
[04:25] So for any drink containing an egg white, the first step is a dry
shake before we actually get
[04:30] to shaking the drink with ice. This is called a dry shake
because it doesn't have any ice in it. This is, usually, when
you talk to your customers
[04:36] and then they tell you their problems. All right.
[04:42] So our first step is complete and see the egg white is
already nice and frothy. So now, we'll add our ice
carefully into the shaken drink.
[04:51] Softer shakes. Right now, I'm cooling down
the temperature in the shaker and it's creating a better
seal between the two cans.
[04:59] Now, that I feel the
shaker is cool enough, I can create an airtight
seal in the Boston shaker
[05:06] and really go for it.
[05:13] Use a large, chilled coupe for this. This is the Hawthorne strainer, which fits this kind of shaker best.
[05:21] And, as a garnish, just
do a little decoration with our Angostura bitters. I'm drawing a line through
the bitters to make a nice,
[05:28] little feathered pattern. And this is your traditional Whiskey Sour. I love Whiskey Sours. I also love making them for people
[05:33] that have never tried them before because people aren't always into the idea of egg whites at first, and then when you hand one to them,
[05:40] they'll taste that it's
just ethereal and fluffy and not eggy at all. Sazerac.
[05:46] Start off with a chilled glass shaker. White sugar cube. We're going to douse this
sugar cube with a good amount
[05:52] of Peychaud's Bitters,
which is the only bitters that makes us a traditional Sazerac. And, as we do, whenever we
have to dissolve a sugar cube,
[05:59] we add just a little drop
of soda water, not a lot. And now, we muddle.
[06:06] Don't be afraid to really
go for it 'cause you do want your sugar to be dissolved. Take out your aggression. Two ounces of rye
[06:12] and crack away.
[06:20] Spoon all the way to the bottom.
[06:29] So while the Sazerac sits on ice, we're going to give our
glass an absinthe rinse. We like to put absinthe into
one of these atomizer bottles.
[06:39] So the traditional garnish for
a Sazerac is a lemon twist. Now, some people like to serve
the lemon with the drink,
[06:45] some people just like to
express the essential oils from the lemon and discard the lemon. I don't want to make anyone mad
[06:51] so what we do at the bar
is put the lemon twist on the inside of the rim, that way people have
the option of, kind of,
[06:58] having the twist or not. A Sazerac is special because
it's one of the first cocktails
[07:04] that used absinthe as a aromatic, just to lend a last bit of
almost seasoning to a drink.
[07:11] Whiskey Fix. We're gonna start with equal
parts fresh lemon juice
[07:17] and simple syrup. Two ounces of whiskey, bourbon
or rye works well for this, I'm using bourbon.
[07:22] We're just going to do what
we call a whip on this drink, which is just shaking
with a small piece of ice.
[07:27] And with this, we're just
trying to lightly chill down the drink, basically, until
the piece of ice dissolves.
[07:36] Chilled double rocks glass. For this, we're gonna use crushed ice and I recommend going to
a fast food restaurant
[07:42] or a fish market and
begging them to give you their crushed ice because
it's the best for this. Steel straw.
[07:48] I use steel straws because
metal straws are good for the environment, but even more so, it's also
really good for conducting
[07:54] the cold temperature of the drink. The Fix gets two garnishes. A lemon wedge and a Luxardo Cherry.
[08:01] And here you are, your
classic Whiskey Fix. A Fix is any cocktail that
consists of lemon juice,
[08:06] simple syrup and a spirit. You can also muddle fresh fruit
into a Fix for seasonality.
[08:12] Who doesn't love seasons? Boulevardier.
[08:17] As always, we're gonna start off with our least expensive ingredients first. We have our sweet vermouth.
[08:23] Campari, which is a
must for a Boulevardier. And bourbon.
[08:31] And give this guy a good stir. And we'll take a chilled coupe. A Boulevardier can also
be served on the rocks
[08:37] but straight up is standard. And the traditional
garnish, an orange twist.
[08:43] This is one of my favorite cocktails, the Boulevardier, which is
often thought of as a cousin
[08:48] to the classic Negroni as they both share sweet
vermouth and Campari as two of the three base ingredients.
[08:54] With a Boulevardier, it's
whisky instead of gin. Presbyterian.
[09:00] A Presbyterian is my
favorite in a category of drinks called a Buck, which is a lime juice,
ginger, spirit drink.
[09:07] So a Moscow Mule, a Kentucky Mule, all examples of Bucks. So to start, half ounce
of lime juice, fresh.
[09:16] And for maximum ginger flavor, we like to use fresh ginger juice. Presbyterian is made with rye.
[09:23] We're going to whip shake this
with a small piece of ice, just to get the base mixture
chilled down slightly.
[09:32] I like to add the first bit
of soda water into the can, that way we get a slight
bit of carbonation
[09:37] that helps mix the soda into the drink as you're pouring it out. And my secret weapon, once again, big ice
[09:45] and top with more soda water. And I like to top these with a little crystallized ginger candy,
[09:50] just so it gives people a
little hint of what they're about to drink. This is a Presbyterian,
the platonic ideal of
[09:56] a whiskey ginger. Blinker. Use a half ounce of grenadine for this.
[10:03] Grenadine is probably my
favorite cocktail syrup. It's made from concentrated, fresh pomegranate juice
sweetened with sugar.
[10:10] Add to that an ounce of fresh
squeezed grapefruit juice and two ounces of rye. What I love about the
blinker is there aren't
[10:17] that many citrus-y, refreshing drinks that people think about when
they think about rye whiskey, and this is really one of those.
[10:22] One big rock for shaking.
[10:29] Hawthorne strainer. This is the Blinker,
a shaken rye cocktail,
[10:34] originated probably around
the mid to late 1940s. Appears in one of the great
cocktail books of all time,
[10:40] The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks. Improved Whiskey Cocktail.
[10:45] Start off with Peychaud's Bitters and just a bar spoon of absinthe. A half ounce of Luxardo maraschino.
[10:51] This was made available in
America in the 19th century and became a very popular sweetener
[10:57] as an alternative to sugar, hence the Improved Whiskey Cocktail. As opposed to an Old Fashioned,
which just used white sugar.
[11:03] And this drink gets a lot of rye. Big rock.
[11:08] I'm trying to just get
a little bit of ice down so that it fits in the
tapered bottom of the glass.
[11:14] And just like with Old Fashioned, you don't need to over-stir this drink. And a nice lemon twist with this guy.
[11:19] This is the Improved Whiskey Cocktail. This whiskey cocktail thinks it's better than other whiskey
cocktails and it's right.
[11:25] Monte Carlo. Let's start with Angostura Bitters, as so many Old Fashioned variations do.
[11:31] Instead of sugar, this gets a herbal and slightly sweetened kick
from Benedictine liqueur. This is a drink bartenders love to make
[11:38] because it has three ingredients in it and it's very fast and very good. This is rye whiskey, big rock in glass,
[11:46] and we'll give this a judicious stirring. So the herbal qualities of the
Benedictine go really nicely
[11:52] with a lemon twist. One of the most popular
riffs on an Old Fashioned. The delightful Monte Carlo,
[11:58] named after a brave man named Carlo who climbed a mountain... I'm kidding, it's named after
the city of Monte Carlo.
[12:05] Mint Julep. First things first, we need a
lot of mint for a Mint Julep. So what I do is use the bottom
leaves off of a brig of mint,
[12:14] save the tops for garnish. And I'm gonna put about
maybe 15 or 16 nice, fresh mint leaves into
the bottom of the glass.
[12:22] So the Mint Julep gets sweetened
with a little bit of sugar to start the abrasion process going, to get those mint oils out.
[12:28] And then, a little bit of
simple syrup to provide the rest of the necessary sweetness. So I'm using the muddler here.
[12:33] I don't wanna over-muddle
the drink either, but just get it crushed up enough. And while I'm doing this,
I'm also spreading the mint
[12:40] around the inside of the glass as well. Two and a half ounces of
bourbon, if you please.
[12:47] Gonna fill this julep tin up
about two thirds of the way with crushed ice. So we're gonna swizzle the drink,
[12:52] which is just to lightly
combine a drink on crushed ice. It gets that crushed ice
a little further down
[12:59] into the glass, making room for more. Add our straw in now,
[13:05] just much easier than if you do it after all the ice is in there. And we take the prettiest
looking mint that we have.
[13:11] I like to lightly tap
the mind against my hand to just get the aromas coming
out of the mint leaves,
[13:17] and give a nice mint flourish. Though I don't know when
this tradition began, it is a really nice
addition to a mint julep
[13:24] to finish it off with a slight
drizzle of Jamaican rum. And there's your mint julep. The official cocktail
of the Kentucky derby.
[13:32] Legally speaking, if you say the phrase, "I do declare," you're supposed
to be holding a mint julep.
[13:40] Martini. Chilled pint glass. More than anything else,
you want a cold martini.
[13:46] Standard martini spec
is one ounce vermouth to two ounces gin. I'd like to go with a London dry gin,
[13:52] and now we're adding some dense ice. All the way up to the top with ice.
[13:58] Chilled coupe glass for
our very cold martini. Julep strainer, crystal
clear and very cold.
[14:04] There are two common
garnishes for a martini, it could either be
olives or a lemon twist.
[14:09] This is a gin martini with a twist. Obviously, one of the most
beloved classic drinks of all time, and one of
the ones that spawned
[14:16] the most variations. This one is the standard. Martinez.
[14:21] Again, in a chilled pint glass. Start off with orange bitters. So traditionally, this
drink calls for equal parts
[14:28] sweet vermouth and Old Tom Gin, and you'll notice that it
is not clear, like most gin.
[14:35] That's because either the
gin has been aged in a barrel or has had malt added to it.
[14:41] Add to that some nice cracked ice. There are fights over
how to garnish this drink
[14:47] and, in this case, the fight
is lemon or orange twist. [whispering] Gonna go lemon. This is the Martinez.
[14:52] It's often thought of as the
predecessor to the Martini. Biggest difference between
the two is that this is made
[14:58] with sweet vermouth
instead of dry vermouth. Gimlet. Gimlet's were traditionally
made with Rose's lime juice
[15:05] but we like them with fresh
lime juice these days. Three quarter ounces of simple syrup and our standard two ounces of gin.
[15:11] This one has a bit more of a
peppery, citrus-y finish to it. We've got our chilled coupe and
a nice big rock for shaking.
[15:21] I'll use two strainers,
both the Hawthorne strainer and a fine mesh strainer to
get those last bits of ice.
[15:28] And that is a Gimlet. One of the oldest, simplest and most refreshing gin cocktails.
[15:34] Gin Rickey. Three very simple, fresh ingredients. Just gin, a simple syrup and lime juice.
[15:41] So a Rickey is, essentially,
a Gimlet but with soda added,
[15:46] served on ice. And there's your Gin Rickey. It's just a simple,
refreshing, fizzy gin cocktail.
[15:52] Negroni. Classic Negroni is just
equal parts sweet vermouth
[15:57] from Turin, if at all possible, London dry gin and Campari. Nice, large rock.
[16:03] Orange twist for this guy. That's a Negroni. Classic Italian cocktail, one of the most refreshing
things you could possibly drink.
[16:11] Corpse Reviver No. 2. It's an equal parts drink. Equal parts lemon, triple
sec, Lillet blanc and gin.
[16:22] Gonna give our chilled coupe
a nice rinse of absinthe and finish that off with
a generous lemon twist.
[16:28] This is the Corpse Reviver No. 2, a classic, refreshing gin drink,
invented by Harry Craddock
[16:34] at the Savoy Hotel in London. Aviation No. 1.
[16:39] As for why it's the number
one, there's also a number two which doesn't contain
the trademark ingredient
[16:45] of creme de violette. Creme de violette is a liqueur
made from the violet flower,
[16:50] but it isn't always available
and when it became scarce, the number two was invested. The gin echoing the presence
of maraschino liqueur
[16:59] in the drink. We're also adding a cherry to the bottom.
[17:05] The weird and wonderful Aviation No. 1. If you ever see creme de
violette in someone's bar
[17:10] and wonder what it's used for, this is it. Tom Collins.
[17:15] We use equal parts lemon and sugar, two ounces of our Old Tom Gin.
[17:21] And we went with a little
bit of soda into the can. And the classic garnish
is a Luxardo Cherry,
[17:29] and a beautiful orange wedge. This is a Tom Collins, similar to a Gin Rickey,
except this is made
[17:35] with lemon juice instead of lime. Ramos Gin Fizz.
[17:40] For this, our citrus is a
split base of lemon juice and lime, and for added complexity,
[17:46] we also use a couple of
drops of orange flower water. Simple syrup. So what makes a Ramos Gin
Fizz special is the merengue
[17:54] that forms from this drink, and what makes the merengue extra fluffy, as opposed to other egg white drinks, is the addition of heavy cream.
[18:00] Two ounces of our gin,
egg white for a foamy top, and it gets a particularly hard dry shake
[18:06] 'cause we're really starting
that merengue right now. I'm gonna be doing this for
a while so let's talk more about the Ramos Gin Fizz.
[18:12] It required so much work that, initially, this used to be a multi-person operation where one waiter would
then hand this drink
[18:19] to another waiter, and then hand this drink to another waiter as they were going along.
[18:24] All right, well, this is great. We already have the beginning of our merengue forming down here.
[18:29] Now, carefully drop our
nice, big shaking rock.
[18:37] So you can see that our nice
merengue is starting to form. We're gonna stick it into
the freezer and let that sit. And we're back, it's
solidified a little bit
[18:44] from sitting in the freezer. If you're a good bartender,
you stick your straw in and it should not move.
[18:50] I guess I'm a good bartender. Take the fizziest seltzer you possibly can
[18:57] and pour it down the straw, and that is your Ramos Gin Fizz.
[19:03] Pretty much universally
agreed upon as the hardest, most work intensive drink
to make from the great city
[19:09] of New Orleans. Bramble. A Bramble is a variation on the Fix,
[19:15] so it's a crushed ice drink
with lemon and sugar and spirit, and before we add the
spirit in so there isn't
[19:21] too much liquid in the glass, we're gonna muddle some
berries in there right now. And just try to make sure
that you crush each one.
[19:28] Now we can add our two ounce pour of gin. We're going to give this
just a little dry shake
[19:33] to incorporate that gin. Straight into a chilled
double rocks glass.
[19:38] So nice. We're gonna fill this up
about two thirds of the way with crushed ice so they
know what we're drinking.
[19:44] This is a Bramble. A dangerously easy to drink
gin number with citrus and fresh fruit.
[19:50] 20th Century. This drink is a weird one and I like it. It has lemon and chocolate
in it and it is very good,
[19:58] trust me. Creme de Cacao. If you can spring a few extra
dollars for the good stuff on this, it makes a huge difference.
[20:04] And a little goes a long way,
you'll have this forever. Using Cocchi Americano, which
aromatized fortified wine.
[20:11] Yeah, just your classic
lemon, wine, chocolate, gin cocktail but for some
reason, it really works.
[20:18] Because we used both Creme de
Cacao and this fortified wine, this gets less than the
usual two ounce pour of gin,
[20:23] it only gets one and a half. And with this drink, we also
finish it with a lemon twist,
[20:30] although most bars like
to express the oils out of this lemon twist
and then discard it.
[20:35] This is a 20th Century. A uniquely flavored, lemony,
chocolatey gin drink invented
[20:41] in 1930, which is in the 20th Century. Bee's Knees.
[20:48] I love the Bee's Knees because
it's sweetened with honey instead of sugar and it
actually is the drink I make
[20:53] the most for friends when I'm scrounging around their kitchen, looking
for ingredients I can use for a cocktail.
[20:59] I use a honey syrup,
which is really just honey that's slightly thinned out
with a little bit of hot water,
[21:04] making it easier to pour. And two ounces of gin.
[21:11] This is the Bee's Knees. One of the things I love
about honey cocktails is that it creates a really
nice foam on the top.
[21:18] Last Word. So in this case, we're using
equal parts fresh lime juice,
[21:24] maraschino liqueur, gin
and green chartreuse, which is very strong stuff.
[21:29] So this drink is one of
those bartender drinks that bartenders really love. I think a Last Word is disgusting.
[21:37] Everybody else loves this drink but me, I'm the crazy one and it's my job to please. "What a great order.
[21:43] "Last Word. "Nice drink." And garnish it with a cherry. The delicious, to most people, Last Word.
[21:53] Vodka Martini. A standard martini always
calls for dry vermouth and either gin or vodka.
[22:00] Modern tastes for vodka
martinis usually mean as dry as possible. I'm going to go with just a drop,
[22:06] although, often, it could be none at all. And because the cocktail is
usually about three ounces in total, with the vodka martini
will usually get a slightly
[22:13] heavier pour than the usual two ounces. Of course, the most popular variation of the vodka martini would
be the dirty martini,
[22:19] which involves olive brine added into it, which is great if you like sea water.
[22:25] I'm gonna give this guy a good stir. This should really feel
pretty much frozen. As with any vodka martini,
it could be served
[22:31] with either olives or a lemon twist. This is a vodka martini.
[22:37] I feel like I'm at a business power lunch just looking at it. Moscow Mule.
[22:43] So just like other drinks
in the buck family, I'll have lime juice and
our fresh ginger syrup
[22:49] and two ounces of vodka. Normally, this is when you would take out
[22:57] the Moscow Mule mug, but I am going to not use
the mug for this because, in my mind, it leads to just
a kind of diluted drink.
[23:05] So I'm gonna make this
the way that I make all my other tall Collins drinks, in a tall glass with
nice, big piece of ice
[23:10] so that you can enjoy
the thing for a while. Add soda.
[23:17] And that's a Moscow Mule. Bonus. If you float bitters on
top of a Moscow Mule,
[23:24] that is now a Headless Horseman and it is delicious.
[23:30] Vesper. I'm going to go with our Cocchi Americano. The original recipe called for
a product called Kina Lillet
[23:39] but it's not made
anymore and this is kinda the closest thing that we've got. Vodka and gin.
[23:50] Vesper was James Bond's girlfriend. Spoiler alert, things
didn't end well for Vesper.
[23:55] And unlike martinis,
where there's an option between olives and lemons,
there is no debate here,
[24:00] this gets a lemon. This is the Vesper, famously
invented by Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond.
[24:06] James Bond got me into
bartending so this drink has a little extra meaning for me.
[24:13] Margarita. Obviously, Margarita's one
of the most popular cocktails in the world.
[24:18] There are so many different
ways that it can be made. It can be shaken, it can be
served down on the rocks, straight up.
[24:24] So, for me, it's just
lime juice, triple sec and silver tequila, the un-aged variety of tequila.
[24:32] And as for glassware, I'm
going to rim this glass. One big rock.
[24:39] Margarita is probably one
of the most popular drinks in the world. It is the national drink of Mexico. I like mine with rocks and salt.
[24:47] Paloma. So this drink is made with
tequila and grapefruit soda, but we're gonna do ours
with fresh grapefruit
[24:54] and lime juice. So this is my spin on a
drink that's usually made with a prepackaged drink.
[25:00] Liquid sugar, two ounces of tequila,
[25:06] shake that guy on our cracked ice, add a little soda to that can.
[25:12] I add a tiny bit of salt to the top which will kind of season that drink.
[25:18] And for a welcome dose of bitterness, a long grapefruit twist.
[25:24] This is a Paloma. Tequila, grapefruit, easy
to drink a lot of 'em.
[25:30] Mexican Firing Squad Special. Equal parts lime and grenadine
[25:35] and a few healthy dashes
of Angostura forms the flavor base for this.
[25:40] And our two ounces of tequila. This drink has a kind of politically incorrect sounding name
[25:46] but it was invented in Mexico
so we're going with it.
[25:52] Soda in the can. And an orange twist to run
the length of the glass.
[25:59] This is a Mexican Firing Squad Special. Daiquiri.
[26:07] Daiquiri couldn't be simpler. It's just three ingredients. Lime juice, simple syrup,
two ounces of white rum.
[26:17] We're gonna double strain
this guy for clarity. This is a daiquiri, or a daiquiri natural.
[26:24] Just rum, lime and sugar. It's pretty much holy to bartenders.
[26:31] Hemingway Daiquiri. Out of many daiquiri variations, this is one of the more popular ones.
[26:37] It's stood the test of time. It is sweetened with maraschino liqueur and also has the addition
of grapefruit juice.
[26:45] This is a Hemingway Daiquiri. Hemingway was famous for not
liking sugar in his drinks,
[26:50] so this one is named after
him for the lack of sugar. Dark N' Stormy.
[26:56] We're using our standard
buck spec of lime juice and fresh ginger syrup.
[27:02] Bermuda rum.
[27:08] This is a Dark N' Stormy. I just really like this drink. The Dark N' Stormy is the
national drink of Bermuda
[27:15] and it is always made with Goslings Rum. If it ain't Goslings,
it ain't Dark N' Stormy.
[27:21] Mai Tai. Here's how you make a Mai Tai. This is Orgeat, it's a
almond-scented syrup used
[27:29] in a variety of tiki drinks. Little goes a long way here. Dry curacao, which is one
of many different kinds
[27:35] of orange liqueurs used
in classic cocktails. Rhum agricole, which is made
from fermented cane syrup
[27:42] and has a really nice funkiness to it. Oh, we're just giving this a quick whip.
[27:51] Release those aromas. I like putting that mint
right next to the straw so that when you bring it to your mouth,
[27:58] you get the aroma coming right at you. And we finish this off with
a drizzle of our strong,
[28:03] funky Jamaican rum. This is a Mai Tai. The sexy grandad of all tiki drinks.
[28:10] Mojito. When making a mojito,
we're going to need a lot of fresh mint.
[28:16] We have a nice, chunky
[mumbles] sugar cube here. And before we add the spirit, just so there isn't too
much liquid in the shaker,
[28:23] we muddle. Two ounces of silver rum. Really not trying to add
a lot of froth or anything
[28:29] to the drink right now,
just to get it combined and into a chilled double rocks glass.
[28:36] Crushed ice to top. Give our mint a little smack. This is a mojito, the
national drink of Cuba.
[28:42] One of the simplest, most
delicious drinks there is. Just rum, lime, sugar and mint.
[28:48] Hotel Nacional Special. Probably my single favorite
rum drink if I had to pick.
[28:53] This is kind of a pineapple
version of a daiquiri, but instead of using sugar to sweeten,
[28:59] we use apricot brandy. If at all possible, use fresh
pineapple juice for this.
[29:05] Last but not least, this
gets just a bar spoon of cane syrup. This gives just a hint of depth.
[29:12] And two ounces of aged rum. And finished, just a dash
of Angostura Bitters.
[29:21] Little feather across the top. This is a Hotel Nacional Special, invented at the Hotel Nacional in Cuba.
[29:27] Highly recommend trying
this one if you haven't. Sidecar.
[29:34] Another great, simple,
three ingredient cocktail. Lemon juice, Cointreau and cognac. For this, we are going to
be going with a dry version
[29:40] of the cocktail. The no sugar version.
[29:45] And we'll finish this guy
off with a lemon twist. The Sidecar is an undisputed classic.
[29:52] A wonderful, sharp,
citrus-y brandy cocktail. French 75.
[29:58] Now, let's start off with a
half ounce each of lemon juice and simple syrup.
[30:03] Technically, a French 75 can
be made with gin or cognac but, for today's purposes, we're going with the cognac version.
[30:15] And what makes a French
75 a French 75, champagne. Quick tip, I like to
hold on to the metal tree
[30:21] when you're taking the
[champagne cork pop] off. All right.
[30:31] And last but not least, the lemon twist. This is a French 75, which
sounds like a beautiful, elegant name but is actually
named for a military cannon
[30:40] because it feels like you got hit by one when you drink one. Brandy Alexander.
[30:47] You only need three things
when making a Brandy Alexander. Brandy, cream and creme de cacao.
[30:55] This is a Brandy Alexander, indulgent and decadent
but surprisingly balanced, just a nice, creamy,
delicious brandy drink.
[31:04] Vieux Carre. Start off with a small amount of our lunk-made benedictine herbal liqueur.
[31:12] And since the Vieux Carre is
a kind of Manhattan variation, it wouldn't be complete without
sweet vermouth and bitters,
[31:20] rye whiskey and, of course, cognac. Big piece of ice. Finished with a lemon twist or an orange,
[31:27] depending on your bartender. Since I'm here and you're on
the other side of the screen and can't say anything, I'm doing lemon.
[31:33] This is a Vieux Carre,
another New Orleans classic. Pink Lady.
[31:39] So when making a Pink Lady, we'll start by cracking an
egg into our large shaker,
[31:44] apart from everything else
we're gonna be mixing. Fresh lemon juice.
[31:49] Nice tart, pomegranate-y grenadine. And as for the hard stuff, the Pink Lady gets a split
base of gin and apple brandy,
[31:59] also known as Apple Jack.
[32:05] [mumbles] [mumbles] This is a Pink Lady. All too often forgotten
but a true classic.
[32:13] Delmonico. Angostura Bitters. Do half ounce each of
dry and sweet vermouths.
[32:22] And for the hard stuff,
we had a split base of London dry gin and French cognac.
[32:28] All the way up to the top and the Delmonico cocktail, of course, was invented at Delmonico's,
[32:33] one of the oldest
restaurants in the country. Nice swath of lemon. The Delmonico cocktail, New York's finest.
[32:42] Jack Rose. To make a Jack Rose, you
just need three things. Fresh lime juice, the
incredible edible grenadine
[32:50] and our apple brandy. The Jack Rose, FYI, is the perfect drink
[32:57] for Thanksgiving dinner. Simple, refreshing, tart, delicious, born in New Jersey. Bonus drink.
[33:03] If you add our absinthe
rinse to a Jack Rose, that's a Pan American Clipper.
[33:11] Aperol Spritz. There are a million ways
to make an Aperol Spritz but this is the classic.
[33:17] Two ounces of Aperol, some ice, three ounces of brut prossecco,
[33:23] your fizziest seltzer and the traditional garnish
would be just a wedge
[33:28] of orange and orange twist, just to get a little extra
orange flavor into the drink but then I throw it out and
don't tell anybody I did it.
[33:36] The Aperol Spritz. You can do it a million different ways but this is the classic. Americano.
[33:43] Traditionally built in the
glass that it's drunk from, so we're gonna start this on ice. Showcasing our vermouth from Turin,
[33:50] just like with the Negroni and Compari. Top 'em with soda and this can be garnished
with either an orange wedge
[33:57] or a nice orange twist. This is an Americano, it's the
predecessor to the Negroni.
[34:03] Champagne Cocktail. Heavily douse this white sugar cube in Angostura Bitters.
[34:10] In Casablanca, they drink
champagne cocktails constantly. If you were to drink a champagne cocktail
[34:16] every time they drink one in
Casablanca, you'd be dead.
[34:21] This is the champagne cocktail which dates back all the
way to the mid-19th century. Bamboo.
[34:28] To make a Bamboo, we need
two kinds of bitters. Angostura and a smaller
amount of orange bitters,
[34:35] and for this, we're using
equal parts dry vermouth and Fino sherry, delicious fortified wine.
[34:44] I don't know who made this up but if you're having a little Bamboo,
[34:49] like a Bamboo shooter, you can call that a Bambooter. A delicious, low alcohol cocktail,
[34:56] [mumbles] back to late 19th century Japan.
[35:01] Pisco Sour. We use just a split base
of the lemon and lime.
[35:08] The reason is simple
that in Peru and Chile, the citrus fruit which
they really would just call
[35:13] the [murmurs] there has a
taste that's kind of right in the middle of the lemons
and limes that we get here. Simple syrup,
[35:19] Pisco, which is technically
in the brandy family but is just really it's own thing,
[35:26] and an egg white. Now, traditionally a Pisco
Sour can be topped with
[35:33] either three dots of Angostura Bitters or grated cinnamon. I like to do both just
because I like the flavor
[35:39] that each one of them lends. This is a Pisco Sour, the national drink of both Chile and Peru.
[35:45] Both countries claim to
have created this drink, I choose not to get
involved in that fight.
[35:50] Caipirinha. For a Caipirinha, we're
going to muddle a fresh lime into the drink.
[35:57] In with our lime wedges,
going to add our friend the sugar cube that we use for most of
[36:02] our muddling applications, as well as some simple syrup. And before we add the base spirit,
[36:08] we'll muddle. And two ounces of Cachaca. Cachaca is a fermented sugar cane product
[36:18] and with the Caipirinha, we really don't wanna
over-shake the drink. We just need to give it
maybe good 10 shakes or so.
[36:26] This is a Caipirinha, the
national drink of Brazil. It uses fresh lime muddled into the drink, which gives it a really
nice, zesty flavor.
[36:33] What I love about classic
cocktails is the rich tradition and history behind each
one of these recipes.
[36:39] Every country has their own
spirit that they're proud of, so you can really kind of have
around the world experience when you're trying out classic cocktails.
[36:46] So either you're trying to
mix these cocktails at home or if you're just going
to a good cocktail bar, I'd recommend ordering
one of these classics,
[36:53] maybe try one you haven't had before and get into the history of it all. Cheers.
