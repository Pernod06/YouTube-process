Trump is letting China win the chip race
======================================================================

[00:02] Inside these containers are a very
[00:04] important computer chip called the H20.
[00:07] It was designed by a company called
[00:09] Nvidia in the US, manufactured in
[00:11] Taiwan, then sold to tech companies in
[00:14] China. In 2025, China was set to get
[00:17] around 1.3 million H20s when suddenly US
[00:21] President Donald Trump blocked them.
[00:23] Why? Because the H20 powers artificial
[00:26] intelligence. And right now, the US and
[00:29] China are locked in an all-out race to
[00:31] dominate artificial intelligence.
[00:33] Whoever wins could gain a stronger
[00:34] economy and a stronger military than the
[00:37] other. Trump wasn't going to help China
[00:39] get those advantages. But 3 months
[00:42] later, Trump had dinner with Nvidia's
[00:44] CEO Jensen Hang. And just days later,
[00:47] Nvidia announced
[00:48] >> that it will resume sales of its
[00:50] advanced H220 chips into China.
[00:52] >> Nvidia's H20 chips, once banned in
[00:55] China, they will be back in play. Judson
[00:56] Huang played both Washington and Beijing
[00:59] and he won.
[01:00] >> Trump's U-turn on AI chips is shocking.
[01:02] >> If there was anything that you'd think
[01:04] people could agree on, it would be that
[01:05] the most advanced AI technology does not
[01:08] go to China
[01:09] >> and it could have huge consequences.
[01:11] >> It is very plausible that if we get this
[01:13] policy wrong, China could be overtaking
[01:16] the United States.
[01:17] >> So why did Trump change his mind on
[01:19] Nvidia chips? And what happens when
[01:21] China gets them?
[01:24] [Music]
[01:36] And away they go.
[01:38] >> Let's imagine the AI race is like a car
[01:40] race. The US and China are each building
[01:43] the best AI or race car they can.
[01:45] They're funding AI research,
[01:47] constructing data centers, and
[01:48] supporting AI companies. At this point,
[01:50] China's car may actually be the faster
[01:52] one. But a race car is only as good as
[01:55] its engine. And an AI's engine is the
[01:57] computer chip. It's a tiny slice of
[02:00] silicon packed with billions of
[02:02] transistors that turn electric signals
[02:04] on and off. Bundle hundreds of thousands
[02:06] of chips together, and you've got the
[02:08] computing power to train and run AI
[02:10] models.
[02:12] China's chip makers like Huawei and
[02:14] Kecon make pretty good AI chips, but US
[02:17] chip makers like Nvidia and AMD make
[02:20] much better ones. Better chips are what
[02:23] allowed US AI to build a lead in the
[02:25] 2010s. But since US chip makers sold
[02:28] chips to China, too, China was able to
[02:30] hang not far behind.
[02:32] >> There has never been a more exciting
[02:34] battle.
[02:36] >> Then around 2018, the US government
[02:38] realized given the stakes of the AI
[02:40] race, it should probably stop helping
[02:42] China.
[02:42] >> AI technology is advancing very quickly
[02:44] and is fast becoming militarily and
[02:47] strategically extremely significant.
[02:49] Chris Magcguire worked on AI chip policy
[02:51] under both presidents Trump and Biden.
[02:53] >> The only area where we have a big
[02:55] advantage over China is in hardware. So
[02:58] if we want to be able to slow the
[03:00] Chinese down, this is our only way of
[03:02] doing it.
[03:02] >> In 2020, Trump blocked Chinese chip
[03:04] makers from using US-made tools to make
[03:06] their chips. Then in 2022, Joe Biden
[03:09] made it illegal for US chip makers to
[03:11] sell their best chips to China. With
[03:13] each new chip, US AI surged ahead, while
[03:17] Chinese AI was stuck using older US
[03:20] chips or inferior Chinese-made chips.
[03:23] >> This was like a boiling the frog effect.
[03:25] The amount that it's going to keep China
[03:26] back is going to increase every year
[03:28] that they're in effect.
[03:29] >> And now starts to pull away.
[03:32] >> These restrictions called export
[03:34] controls change the game. But they cost
[03:36] US chip makers a lot of potential
[03:38] business, especially for the best chip
[03:40] maker, Nvidia.
[03:44] Just 15 years ago, Nvidia was designing
[03:46] chips for video games when researchers
[03:48] discovered Nvidia chips were also great
[03:50] for powering AI models. The discovery
[03:53] gave Nvidia a head start on the AI boom.
[03:56] By 2023, it made more than 90% of AI
[03:59] data center chips. The world wants to
[04:02] run on Nvidia chips, and that's because
[04:04] it's so much easier to use Nvidia than
[04:06] to use anything else.
[04:07] >> Gregory Allen studies AI policy. The
[04:10] best chips that are being made by
[04:12] Chinese manufacturing facilities are
[04:14] around five years behind that of Nvidia.
[04:18] And in fact, Chinese military documents
[04:20] when AI is involved, they're asking for
[04:23] Nvidia chips. Before Biden's
[04:25] restrictions, 22% of Nvidia's revenue
[04:28] came from selling chips to China. But
[04:30] after, just 13% did. These restrictions
[04:34] were hurting business. So Nvidia found a
[04:37] genius way around them.
[04:39] This story is moving pretty fast. It
[04:40] took a lot of extra reporting. It took a
[04:42] lot of extra research going all over the
[04:44] internet and that often leads to many
[04:46] more spam texts and emails and it gets
[04:48] really annoying. Thankfully, I protect
[04:50] myself through my subscription to
[04:52] Incogn. And I'm thrilled to have Incogn
[04:54] sponsor this episode. So, there are
[04:56] hundreds of these data brokers out
[04:58] there. They take the personal
[04:59] information you give out on the
[05:00] internet, your login, your addresses,
[05:02] your passwords, even your social
[05:04] security number, and they sell it to
[05:06] marketers. That's how you get those spam
[05:08] texts and emails, but it's also how your
[05:10] information can fall into the hands of
[05:11] criminals. Now, we have the right to
[05:13] take that data back, but it would take
[05:15] forever to do it ourselves. That's when
[05:16] Incogn. They'll do it for you, and it
[05:19] takes three easy steps. Step one, you
[05:21] create an account. Tell Incogn whose
[05:22] personal data you want them to remove.
[05:24] Step two is you grant Incogn behalf.
[05:27] Incogn will go out and contact those
[05:29] data brokers. Step three, you sit back
[05:31] and relax and watch Incogn do the work
[05:33] for you. It'll send you a progress
[05:34] report all along the way. So, here's the
[05:36] deal. Right now, use the code search
[05:38] party at the link below and you're going
[05:39] to get 60% off Incogn's annual plan.
[05:42] Now, I've been using Incogn for a few
[05:44] years. I love it. If you want to keep
[05:46] your personal data safe on the internet
[05:48] while supporting Search Party in the
[05:49] meantime, Incogn is a great way to do
[05:51] it. So, thanks again to Incogn for
[05:53] supporting our work. Now, I'll get you
[05:55] back to the story.
[05:57] Each AI chip is judged by its power and
[06:00] its interconnect speed. That's how fast
[06:01] it can talk to other chips. In 2022,
[06:04] Biden banned selling any chip above
[06:06] these limits, which included Nvidia's
[06:08] best. So, Nvidia took its H100 chip and
[06:12] degraded it to create a new version that
[06:14] fell under the limits, the H800.
[06:17] Chinese AI companies bought as many as
[06:19] they could. Then, when Biden tightened
[06:21] the restrictions, Nvidia designed
[06:23] another new chip, the H20. It wasn't
[06:26] powerful, but it was very fast, which
[06:28] made it ideal for serving AI models to
[06:31] millions of users. Chinese AI companies
[06:34] again bought as many as they could and
[06:36] smuggled in some chips. By 2025, largely
[06:39] thanks to Nvidia chips, they were
[06:40] showing incredible progress.
[06:42] >> Financial markets have been reacting to
[06:44] Deep Seek.
[06:44] >> Deep Seek.
[06:45] >> Deep Seek, a company with a collection
[06:46] of Chinese AI models
[06:48] >> that claims to beat out even open AI
[06:51] >> and it used Nvidia H800.
[06:54] >> They're catching up quickly. We cannot
[06:56] blink at all.
[06:59] So, the Chinese market is scooping up
[07:01] these chips as fast as they can. They're
[07:03] saying whatever the best NVIDIA chips
[07:05] were allowed to buy, that's what we
[07:06] want. So, in April 2025, the US, this
[07:09] time under Trump again, blocked the H20.
[07:12] But instead of making a new chip, Nvidia
[07:14] CEO went to Trump with a new argument,
[07:17] and Trump agreed with him.
[07:19] >> President Trump really understands and
[07:21] really wants and his it's his policy to
[07:24] have America win the AI race. The Trump
[07:27] administration and Nvidia are making two
[07:29] main arguments for why it should sell
[07:31] chips to China. And the first one is
[07:33] that it'll make a lot of money.
[07:34] >> And we have an opportunity to go capture
[07:36] some of that $50 billion. It's great for
[07:39] exports. It's great for our treasury.
[07:42] >> That's true. Nvidia stock climbed to a
[07:44] new record when Trump reversed the ban.
[07:46] And Trump's policy that the US will take
[07:48] 15% of chip sales could generate
[07:50] billions of dollars for the government.
[07:52] But the second argument is a little more
[07:54] counterintuitive. You want to sell the
[07:56] Chinese enough that their developers get
[07:59] addicted to the American technology
[08:02] stack.
[08:02] >> He means that selling H20s to China is a
[08:05] trap. Let me show you.
[08:08] If the Nvidia H20 is the best chip
[08:10] available, then Chinese AI companies
[08:12] will choose to buy it over a
[08:14] Chinese-made chip. If no one buys
[08:16] China's chips, Chinese chip makers will
[08:18] struggle to make better ones. Then if
[08:21] the US strings China along with better
[08:23] chips, eventually Chinese AI will have
[08:25] no choice but to continue using US
[08:27] chips. They'll be addicted to them. Then
[08:30] as US AI advances, it can keep China a
[08:33] few steps behind until the US wins the
[08:35] AI race. Honestly, seems like a solid
[08:38] plan. This is not completely insane. We
[08:41] will help Chinese AI companies, but we
[08:44] will hurt Chinese semiconductor
[08:46] companies. That's the thesis. But many
[08:48] experts say there's just one problem
[08:50] with that. Trump's plan assumes that the
[08:52] Chinese government will let its
[08:54] chipmakers fall behind. And well,
[08:56] >> there's no chance that's going to
[08:58] happen.
[08:58] >> The Chinese government is pumping
[09:00] billions of dollars into its chipmakers,
[09:02] mandating that its AI companies use 50%
[09:04] Chinese-made chips. And its leader,
[09:06] Xiinping, is demanding it eventually
[09:08] reach self-sufficiency in AI. All of
[09:11] that means
[09:12] >> they'll get there eventually. The chips
[09:14] won't be as good as Nvidia's, but
[09:16] they'll go from basically unusable to at
[09:19] least workable. And once they cross that
[09:21] threshold, they're just going to get off
[09:22] of Nvidia. They just are. That's the
[09:25] flaw in Trump's plan. He's not getting
[09:28] China addicted to US chips. He's letting
[09:30] China use Nvidia chips to stay in the
[09:32] race until its own chip makers can catch
[09:34] up. The H20 is a bridge to a future
[09:38] without US chips. And once China gets
[09:40] there, many experts believe it can pull
[09:42] close or even with the US.
[09:44] >> This is the playbook. We should not help
[09:47] them execute their playbook. It's just
[09:48] not in America's national security
[09:50] interest.
[09:51] >> And it's there that they can pass. Look
[09:53] at the courage as they both refuse to
[09:55] back off.
[09:59] >> Yet Trump is considering letting Nvidia
[10:00] sell an even better chip to China.
[10:02] >> The Blackwell. Do you know what the
[10:04] Blackwell is? The Blackwell is super
[10:06] duper advanced. The Blackwell or B30 is
[10:09] 12 times more powerful and 11 times
[10:11] faster than the H20. They would let
[10:14] China easily catch the US and likely
[10:16] surpass it.
[10:18] >> I think that's absolutely possible.
[10:19] >> Everything else, like I said before, is
[10:21] not in our favor and the Chinese might
[10:23] be able to leaprog us.
[10:25] >> Out of the slipstream, he's taking the
[10:27] lead.
[10:28] An incredible achievement.
[10:33] >> Right now, Trump and China are
[10:35] negotiating a trade deal. And it looks
[10:36] like China is angling to get those black
[10:39] weld chips.
[10:41] China's reportedly banning its AI
[10:42] companies from buying Nvidia chips and
[10:45] calling its own chips comparable to the
[10:46] H20. This could be the Chinese
[10:48] government pressuring its AI companies
[10:50] to use Chinese-made chips. Or could be a
[10:53] way to pressure Nvidia to pressure the
[10:54] Trump administration into letting Nvidia
[10:57] sell black wells to China. If Trump
[10:59] gives in, expect Chinese AI to get
[11:02] really good really fast. If we start to
[11:04] see models that are as good that are
[11:06] released around the same time as US as
[11:08] Frontier US models or better, that would
[11:10] show they squandered our compute
[11:12] advantage.
[11:13] >> It's a crucial moment in the AI race.
[11:16] What the US decides to do right now
[11:18] could determine how close it is.
[11:21] Maybe who wins it.
