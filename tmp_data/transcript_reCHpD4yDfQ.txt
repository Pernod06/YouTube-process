[00:00] NASA's estimated budget of $500 billion
[00:01] for a human landing on Mars
[00:04] could buy 1.36 Alis, 3.5 NBA leagues, or
[00:07] build 100 Apple Towers. Park, buying 140 billion cups of coffee
[00:11] is only enough for OpenAI to build one Stargate data center.
[00:13] But this may just be the beginning
[00:15] ; its ambition may be ten times or even more.
[00:18] In addition to OpenAI
[00:19] , tech giants such as xAI and Meta
[00:21] have also started to spend money like crazy on AI data centers,
[00:23] starting a global infrastructure frenzy
[00:26] and betting on a new trillion-dollar market.
[00:27] But behind the frenzy, we can't help but ask
[00:30] where all this money is going.
[00:32] Hello everyone,
[00:32] welcome to "Silicon Valley 101".
[00:34] I am Chen Qian.
[00:34] In this video, we will take a look at
[00:37] the capital expenditure behind AI data centers.
[00:39] What are the components of a data center?
[00:41] Who are the main upstream and downstream companies and players?
[00:44] How exactly is the money spent
[00:45] ? Interestingly, after reviewing various reports, we
[00:47] found that everyone's budget is different.
[00:50] So who is right?
[00:52] Some data centers have even been "forced" to go to space.
[00:54] Why?
[00:55] Why is capital still pouring in
[00:58] when AI is being questioned as a bubble ? Let's first look at
[01:06] the cost analysis of
[01:07] next-generation AI data centers by Bank of America
[01:09] on October 15 this year.
[01:11] We divide the expenditure of data centers into four main categories
[01:14] : IT equipment, power supply equipment,
[01:16] cooling equipment, and engineering construction
[01:18] . For easier comparison,
[01:19] we'll standardize the unit of measurement to expenditure per GW.
[01:25] First, let's look at IT equipment directly related to computing
[01:29] , specifically servers, networks, and storage.
[01:31] Servers account for the largest share
[01:34] , approximately $37.5 billion per GW.
[01:37] Servers include
[01:41] crucial components like CPUs, GPUs, memory, and motherboards,
[01:42] typically supplied directly by ODMs (Original Design Manufacturers)
[01:44] , such as Foxconn.
[01:46] These companies obtain server design standards
[01:49] from chip design companies like Nvidia and AMD and manufacture complete systems
[01:52] , supplying directly to hyperscale clients like
[01:54] Oracle, Meta, and Amazon.
[01:56] ODMs hold a 46% share of the server market.
[01:59] Other small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) need to purchase servers
[02:02] from OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) like
[02:04] Dell, Supermicro, and HP.
[02:06] In the networking sector,
[02:07] $3.75 billion per GW is needed for network equipment.
[02:11] Major players include
[02:12] Arista, Cisco, Huawei, and Nvidia.
[02:15] It's worth noting that
[02:16] although Nvidia only holds a 5% market share
[02:20] , some industry experts argue
[02:22] that while Nvidia's InfiniBand
[02:24] network communication standard is more expensive
[02:26] , its low latency... The advantages of delayed response and no packet loss risk
[02:29] are more suitable for AI data centers.
[02:32] Finally, there's storage, specifically hard drives.
[02:34] Each GW requires $1.9 billion in storage equipment.
[02:38] Major players include
[02:39] Samsung, SK, Micron, and Seagate.
[02:42] Adding these three items together
[02:44] , we arrive at $43.15 billion per GW for
[02:45] IT equipment
[02:49] —the bulk of data center spending.
[02:52] While IT equipment is core
[02:54] , the entire data center's support system is equally crucial.
[02:58] Next, let's look at the cooling system.
[03:00] First, let me tell you a story:
[03:05] In 2018, an Atlanta data center
[03:08] suffered a cyberattack,
[03:09] forcing the closure of multiple city services,
[03:11] including courts, police stations, and airports.
[03:13] Besides locking data with ransomware, the attackers
[03:16] also compromised the cooling system.
[03:20] After the system was compromised,
[03:21] the ambient temperature soared to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit,
[03:24] damaging many chips.
[03:26] The hackers even held the servers
[03:28] and cooling system hostage,
[03:30] demanding $51,000 in Bitcoin.
[03:33] Later, attacks on cooling systems became increasingly common
[03:36] and sophisticated.
[03:38] This story illustrates the critical importance
[03:39] of the cooling system for a data center.
[03:42] Although the construction budget only accounts for 3% of the total cost,
[03:46] with the exponential upgrade of global AI computing power demand,
[03:49] traditional air cooling technology is struggling to meet
[03:52] the heat dissipation needs of high-density computing equipment. Furthermore
[03:54] , for NVIDIA GPUs,
[03:56] heat dissipation capacity has
[03:58] become a core bottleneck restricting computing power.
[04:00] Therefore, for data centers,
[04:02] liquid cooling has gone from an alternative
[04:05] to a necessity
[04:06] . For data centers equipped with liquid cooling systems,
[04:09] the cooling equipment mainly includes
[04:11] cooling towers, chillers, CDUs (cooling distribution units),
[04:14] and CRAHs (data center air handling units).
[04:17] To handle 1GW of cooling,
[04:19] these would require expenditures of
[04:20] $0.9 billion, $3.6 billion, $4.5 billion, and $5.75 billion
[04:25] respectively , totaling $1.475 billion.
[04:27] Major suppliers are
[04:29] numerous and scattered across various stages, so we won't list them all
[04:32] , but
[04:32] Vertiv, Johnson Controls, Stuttgart, and Schneider Electric
[04:36] are all major players in this field.
[04:37] Having discussed cooling and
[04:39] power as core infrastructure,
[04:41] let's look at the power supply equipment.
[04:46] Power supply equipment mainly includes
[04:47] emergency power supply, backup diesel generators,
[04:50] power distribution control switching equipment, and
[04:52] UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)
[04:53] to ensure uninterrupted power
[04:54] supply. The busbars and other power distribution equipment that supply power to each generator unit (Power Supply)
[04:58] are estimated by Bank of America
[04:59] to cost $400,000 to $550,000 per MW for a
[05:01] typical diesel generator.
[05:05] Fuel tanks, fuel pumps, and installation costs combined
[05:08] are approximately $350,000 to $500,000
[05:10] , making the cost of a generator per MW
[05:12] approximately $800,000.
[05:14] Providing 1GW of power
[05:16] would require $800 million in emergency generators.
[05:19] However, according to our guests,
[05:20] the actual cost is far higher
[05:22] due to redundancy.
[05:24] If your IT (equipment) capacity (power consumption) reaches,
[05:27] for example, 1GW,
[05:29] you often need more than 1GW of diesel generators.
[05:33] There are several reasons for this
[05:34] , but the most important is
[05:35] ensuring redundancy.
[05:37] For some data centers with particularly high reliability requirements,
[05:40] the number of diesel generators
[05:42] may be twice the data center's computing power.
[05:45] For example, a 1GW data center
[05:48] might require 2GW of diesel generators.
[05:50] The biggest players
[05:52] in the diesel generator market
[05:54] are Caterpillar , Cummins, and Rolls-Royce, which
[05:57] are roughly equal . In addition, a 1GW data center
[05:59] also requires $615 million in switchgear, $
[06:02] 985 million in UPS systems, and $300 million in power distribution equipment.
[06:05] The three major players in these electrical equipment
[06:08] are Schneider Electric, Vertiv, and Eaton.
[06:10] Therefore, the total cost of the power supply infrastructure
[06:12] is calculated per GW... $2.7 billion is
[06:15] only 1/13th of the cost of IT equipment
[06:17] , which seems quite cheap.
[06:20] Although power supply is free
[06:21] ,
[06:22] it has become a core bottleneck for many data centers in the United States.
[06:25] We will discuss this in more detail later in the video.
[06:28] Let's first draw the complete pie chart of this expenditure.
[06:31] The last item is construction
[06:37] costs. Construction costs include
[06:39] building costs, installation costs, general contractor fees, etc.
[06:43] The estimated cost for each GW of construction is approximately $4.28 billion
[06:47] . We calculated
[06:49] that the total expenditure
[06:51] for building a 1GW data center is approximately $51.6 billion
[06:55] , with IT equipment accounting for the highest proportion of
[06:56] the cost, reaching 84%.
[06:59] Therefore,
[07:00] OpenAI's 10GW Stargate project
[07:03] would cost $516 billion.
[07:05] This is very close
[07:08] to the officially announced $500 billion investment.
[07:10] However, while reviewing various research reports, we
[07:13] found something interesting:
[07:15] the data provided by
[07:16] different institutions varies greatly.
[07:20] For example, taking Stargate as an example,
[07:22] the total budget estimated by different institutions
[07:24] differs by as much as $200 billion.
[07:27] Why is this?
[07:28] How should we interpret these calculation discrepancies
[07:31] ? Let's elaborate a bit more.
[07:37] First, let's look at the predictions from several different institutions.
[07:40] Bernstein's report released on November 1st stated that
[07:43] the cost of each GW of AI data center is approximately $35 billion
[07:47] , and the expenditure breakdown for each item
[07:49] also differs from Bank of America's prediction.
[07:51] For instance, the total expenditure for IT equipment related to GPUs, networks, CPUs,
[07:54] and storage is 56%,
[07:56] far lower than the 84% calculated by Bank of America.
[07:59] Barclays Bank
[08:00] 's report at the end of October indicated that
[08:02] the expenditure for each GW of AI data center
[08:04] is $50-60 billion
[08:06] , with 65-70% used for computing and networking.
[08:10] And in August of this year,
[08:11] Morgan... Stanley's research model
[08:13] estimates a cost of $33.5 billion per GW
[08:16] , with computing equipment accounting for 41%
[08:19] and the remaining 59%
[08:20] allocated to infrastructure such as power and cooling.
[08:24] Why then are the predictions
[08:25] so disparate?
[08:27] There are two main reasons.
[08:28] First, the assumptions differ.
[08:31] Bank of America's calculations focus
[08:33] on Nvidia's
[08:35] Rubin architecture , released in early September
[08:36] , which is expected to be available by the end of 2026.
[08:38] Bernstein and Morgan Stanley's calculations focus on
[08:41] the Blackwell architecture, to be released in March 2024.
[08:44] Bernstein's GPU costs $13.65 billion (13.65 billion USD), while
[08:48] BofA's (Bank of America) Future (future data center)
[08:50] costs $37.5 billion (37.5 billion USD).
[08:52] This difference alone is over 20 billion USD
[08:55] , which I feel is the biggest difference
[08:57] . Therefore, the biggest difference
[08:59] in the calculated amounts lies in the different chip prices,
[09:02] resulting in a $20 billion difference per GW.
[09:04] The costs of other facilities like power supply and cooling
[09:07] don't differ significantly.
[09:08] However, this also suggests that
[09:10] Jensen's next-generation chips will be more expensive,
[09:12] a new "
[09:14] Jensen's Mathematics." Math
[09:15] estimates that the total cost of a 1GW AI data center
[09:18] is between $600 and $800 billion
[09:20] , even higher than predictions from other institutions. The
[09:23] "computing cost," which
[09:25] represents Nvidia's potential revenue,
[09:27] is approximately
[09:29] $ 400 to $500 billion
[09:31] . I think Nvidia's assessment is probably accurate
[09:33] ; they know what price they want to set, right?
[09:35] They've calculated the energy consumption,
[09:37] the price, and
[09:38] how much profit they expect to make.
[09:41] The second reason is the difference in the scope of calculation.
[09:43] BofA (Bank of America) calculates
[09:47] the cost of
[09:49] the data center building
[09:50] itself , while Bernstein calculates
[09:52] the cost of the entire data center campus,
[09:56] including the power distribution system
[09:59] and generators.
[10:00] I feel that
[10:02] BofA's generators
[10:03] are primarily
[10:05] backup diesel generators,
[10:06] while Bernstein's generators
[10:08] are gas generators.
[10:10] Turbines are essentially self-generating generators .
[10:14] Therefore, considering all factors,
[10:15] our guests believe that
[10:17] the budget provided by Bank of America
[10:20] for the future data centers built by tech giants
[10:23] is closer to the reality.
[10:25] So, this episode's estimate
[10:27] is based on the Bank of America report. As
[10:29] we mentioned earlier,
[10:30] electricity will become a bottleneck for data centers.
[10:33] This is why you see
[10:35] generators both inside and outside the data centers in our animation.
[10:38] There will be a significant hidden expense
[10:39] in
[10:41] electricity investment
[10:44] . Let's continue discussing this.
[10:52] We previously did a video and podcast
[10:54] discussing the power shortages caused by AI
[10:56] and why the US is so short of electricity
[10:58] . A year and a half later,
[11:00] the situation hasn't improved.
[11:02] Now, tech giants
[11:04] have to invest in building their own power plants
[11:06] to obtain electricity. OpenAI or its partners like Oracle
[11:08] need to find ways to create new capacity.
[11:12] Many tech companies now
[11:14] ... They have to build their own generators, power plants,
[11:17] substations, and distribution network facilities
[11:19] , and even some shorter power transmission lines,
[11:22] to meet their own needs.
[11:23] If you want to equip a 10GW data center
[11:26] with a power plant,
[11:28] the cost could reach
[11:30] $120-200 billion.
[11:34] So we also see
[11:35] that the large-scale infrastructure construction of AI data centers
[11:37] has boosted the power stocks
[11:39] , which were considered a "sunset industry."
[11:41] Their gas turbine orders are even booked up for three years.
[11:44] Google once spent $3 billion
[11:47] to upgrade two hydroelectric power plants in Pennsylvania
[11:49] in order to obtain 3,000MW of power.
[11:52] This means that it would cost $1 billion to acquire 1GW.
[11:56] And this is just the cost of upgrading
[11:57] . Musk
[12:00] also acquired a power plant for the Colossus 2 project.
[12:02] Data centers are fiercely competing for power.
[12:04] Some analysts believe
[12:06] that companies like GE
[12:08] have the ability to pay a premium
[12:09] (to purchase) 1GW (generators),
[12:10] which may be equivalent to $2.5 billion (US dollars).
[12:12] $2.5 billion is a potentially high figure.
[12:13] I think if you use $2 billion, it'll be around
[12:16] the CapEx (capital expenditure).
[12:17] Here's the problem:
[12:19] data centers already have emergency generators,
[12:22] so why not just use them for power ?
[12:25] There's a fundamental difference between
[12:27] emergency diesel generators
[12:29] and large natural gas turbine generators.
[12:31] Diesel generators
[12:32] are primarily used as backup power,
[12:36] so
[12:37] all their components
[12:39] are optimized for high power and short bursts.
[12:43] Therefore, they can't handle 24/7
[12:46] operation.
[12:48] Natural gas turbine generators,
[12:50] on the other hand, are designed for
[12:51] scenarios
[12:53] like running
[12:54] almost every hour of the year.
[12:56] There are other reasons as well.
[12:57] Diesel is a relatively expensive fuel,
[13:00] while natural gas generators
[13:02] use natural gas
[13:04] , which can be piped . The cost of
[13:06] generating the same amount of electricity
[13:07] from a diesel generator
[13:09] is likely 3 to 8 times that of a natural gas generator.
[13:13] So, the construction of data centers
[13:15] is currently stuck on obtaining power.
[13:17] The US power grid can't provide enough power, and
[13:20] natural gas turbine generators are unavailable.
[13:23] This has spurred the development of other methods
[13:26] , such as fuel cells, which are becoming increasingly popular.
[13:29] Even tech giants are being "forced" into space.
[13:32] Google's latest news is that
[13:33] they plan to send a data center into space in 2027.
[13:36] The main reason is that
[13:37] using solar panels in space
[13:40] can generate electricity at eight times the efficiency on Earth
[13:42] , and it can also solve the problem of no solar energy at night,
[13:45] which is essentially a free and unlimited energy supply.
[13:47] In addition,
[13:49] vacuum and radiation heat dissipation in space can
[13:52] reduce the need for cooling systems.
[13:54] In addition to Google, Microsoft, Amazon
[13:56] , and Musk's SpaceX
[13:57] , all have started exploring this area.
[13:59] So how much does it cost to build a space data center?
[14:02] On LinkedIn,
[14:03] we saw that some people predict that
[14:06] the cost of building a 1MW space data center
[14:09] , including launch costs,
[14:10] is about $35.5 million.
[14:13] If it is 1GW,
[14:15] it will be $35.5 billion
[14:17] . However, this does not seem to be much more expensive than on Earth.
[14:20] We plan to make a separate video
[14:23] to discuss
[14:24] the challenges and opportunities behind
[14:27] the feasibility of space data centers.
[14:28] Don't forget to follow us.
[14:34] Since building AI data centers is so costly
[14:38] , and the market is full of doubts and doubts about a bubble,
[14:41] why does this infrastructure boom only increase?
[14:45] According to the guests we interviewed,
[14:46] there are two main reasons
[14:48] . First, underinvestment is riskier than overinvestment.
[14:53] Most companies now realize
[14:54] that underinvestment
[14:56] is riskier than overinvestment.
[14:59] The risks of insufficient investment
[15:01] far outweigh those of overinvestment. Why? Because whoever acquires the best AI model or AGI first will likely capture a large market share, rapidly shrinking the survival space of other companies. Now let's look at the risks of overinvestment. You
[15:04] 've
[15:05] essentially
[15:09] bought
[15:10] more
[15:14] land
[15:17] ,
[15:18] more
[15:19] electricity
[15:20] , and more buildings
[15:23] to build data centers.
[15:24] In the end, you might find that you've overspent
[15:26] , but you can use it for
[15:27] internal
[15:30] efficiency improvements
[15:31] , lease it out
[15:33] , or sell the land and electricity to other companies.
[15:36] Overall, the risks of overinvestment
[15:38] have a ceiling.
[15:40] The second reason is that
[15:42] as long as there's computing power
[15:43] , tech companies will always find a way to utilize it.
[15:46] There's a saying in Silicon Valley
[15:47] : "Bill will always eat Andy.
[15:49] " As long as you have infrastructure
[15:51] , hardware,
[15:52] and servers, there will always be a way
[15:53] to use it.
[15:55] Earlier this week, OCP... Meta's representatives stated
[15:58] that their current GPUs
[16:00] already require significant computing power
[16:02] just for internal AI tasks
[16:04] like filtering inappropriate content for
[16:07] Instagram or Facebook
[16:09] . Even with surplus idle computing power
[16:11] , it could be fully utilized
[16:14] for internal cost reduction.
[16:15] Therefore, I believe mainstream companies
[16:18] aren't worried about
[16:19] overinvestment.
[16:20] We see
[16:21] that even with market skepticism
[16:23] about AI overinvestment,
[16:25] giants are still investing heavily .
[16:28] The final question is,
[16:29] where does the trillion-dollar demand come from?
[16:33] It comes from
[16:34] the self-generated money of these
[16:35] hyperscale cloud service providers.
[16:36] They reinvest
[16:38] their profits and debts.
[16:40] Ultimately, it relies on the
[16:42] public market—
[16:44] the US investment-grade
[16:45] or high-yield
[16:46] bond market—and
[16:47] the emerging
[16:49] shadow banking system
[16:51] , also known
[16:52] as
[16:53] private credit.
[16:55] These large financing channels
[16:58] support the entire AI build-up . The infrastructure boom
[17:01] isn't unprecedented in American history.
[17:03] I think AI is more like a large-scale
[17:06] global infrastructure cycle
[17:08] . As long as you (AI) can make money,
[17:09] you're a global growth driver,
[17:11] so you don't really need to worry about money.
[17:13] This seemingly crazy investment
[17:15] is essentially a
[17:17] game of "who gets to the future first."
[17:19] This path may be risky
[17:21] , but for tech giants,
[17:23] the cost of "absence"
[17:24] is higher than the cost of "investing wrongly."
