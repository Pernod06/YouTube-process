How China Launched a New Industrial Revolution
======================================================================

[00:00] This is Gonghe Talatan Solar Park,
the world's largest
[00:04] solar power plant,
sprawling across China's Qinghai Province.
[00:08] It is so big that if ran at full capacity,
[00:11] it could power
the entire country of Norway.
[00:15] And it's not alone. Zoom out,
[00:17] and China's deserts are covered
in vast solar and wind projects.
[00:21] The largest three solar plants and three
[00:25] wind farms are all located in China.
[00:28] The numbers are jaw dropping.
[00:30] In 2024 alone, China invested $940
[00:34] billion in clean energy technology.
[00:37] That's more than the entire GDP of Poland,
[00:39] and only slightly behind the world's
total investment in fossil fuels.
[00:44] China
accounted for 64% of all new renewable
[00:48] energy capacity added across the globe
last year, and also produced
[00:52] 70% of all electric vehicles
anywhere in the world.
[00:56] This is all part of
Xi Jinping's Made in China 2025.
[01:00] China is in the process
[01:01] of fundamentally transforming
both its own and the global economy.
[01:05] But how did they do this?
[01:07] Is China winning or just cheating?
[01:09] And what does it mean for the world
economy
[01:12] in an era of protectionism and tariffs?
This is Made in China.
[01:16] The New Industrial Revolution.
[01:22] China's journey to
[01:23] global industrial superpower started
more than 40 years
[01:26] ago, in the aftermath
of the death of Chairman Mao Zedong.
[01:30] Mao remains an icon in China today,
but its economic legacy is mixed,
[01:34] to say the least.
[01:35] In a bid to rapidly industrialize
the country and achieve economic
[01:39] self-sufficiency, Mao
launched the Great Leap Forward in 1958.
[01:44] It was a catastrophe.
Mass collectivization of agriculture,
[01:48] huge investment in heavy industry
and inefficient central planning backfired
[01:52] spectacularly,
leading to famine that resulted
[01:55] in the deaths of between 15
and 55 million people.
[02:00] Mao died in 1976, leaving behind a poor,
largely agrarian economy and a country
[02:06] still reeling from the political chaos
of the Cultural Revolution.
[02:10] His successor, Deng Xiaoping, a man purged
and exiled by Mao for being a capitalist
[02:15] rodent, remarkably rose to power in 1978
after the carnage of the Mao years.
[02:22] Deng saw the need for profound
economic reform.
[02:25] He sought to win back
the ideological emphasis on state planning
[02:29] and collective ownership
that had defined Mao's China.
[02:32] His market pragmatism was encapsulated
in his saying: it doesn't matter
[02:36] if a cat is black or white,
as long as it catches mice.
[02:40] Under the slogan 改革开放
[02:42] “Reform and opening
up”, Deng began a process
[02:46] of gradual economic liberalization
throughout the 80s.
[02:49] That meant allowing markets to set prices,
opening up to foreign investment,
[02:53] and allowing entrepreneurs
to set up private businesses.
[02:56] As Deng's reforms
took hold in the 90s, China's economic
[02:59] growth started to pick up.
[03:00] Between 1980 and 2000.
[03:02] GDP per capita grew fivefold,
[03:04] fueled by surging exports
from Chinese factories to foreign markets.
[03:08] Around this time, Beijing set up
[03:10] economic special zones,
inspired by the advice of Lee Kuan Yew,
[03:14] with preferential tax and business
incentives to stimulate investment.
[03:17] The most famous
special economic zone was a once quiet
[03:21] fishing village on the border of Hong
Kong called Shenzhen.
[03:24] In the 90s,
Shenzhen was a boom town, attracting
[03:27] thousands of workers from across
rural China to work in its factories,
[03:31] which produced everything
from pens, clothes and watch batteries.
[03:35] One of these workers was a young man
called Wang Chuan Fu.
[03:39] Born to a poor family of eight children
in rural Anhui province in central China,
[03:43] Wang worked hard at school
[03:44] and went to study chemistry at university
in nearby Hunan province.
[03:48] After finishing university,
he joined a new battery company
[03:51] in Shenzhen, and two years later
he left to launch his own company
[03:55] focused on making affordable
rechargeable batteries.
[03:58] He called the company Yadi Electronics
[04:00] after the Yadi road in Shenzhen,
where it was originally based.
[04:04] Wang and his new company
[04:05] would go on to be a microcosm of the story
of modern China.
[04:08] In the 90s,
[04:09] Chinese manufacturing had one thing
really going for it: super low wages.
[04:13] In 1995, China's GDP per
capita was just over $600 in current U.S.
[04:18] terms versus more than 12,000 and South
Korea and 44,000 in Japan.
[04:23] This allowed producers like Wang’s Yadi
Electronics to outcompete larger
[04:27] Japanese manufacturers
like Toyota and Sony on price,
[04:30] despite Japan's superior technology
and advanced production lines.
[04:34] And business was booming.
[04:36] By 2000, Yadi Electronics had grown
[04:38] to become the world's
largest mobile phone battery manufacturer.
[04:42] And Wang took the company public
on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2002.
[04:46] In the process
raising over 200 million USD
[04:49] and cementing his status as one of China's
top new capitalist entrepreneurs.
[04:54] And by this point, the company had a name
that you might be more familiar with:
[04:58] BYD. China's
rapid economic rise continued
[05:02] over the 2000s
[05:03] under the leadership of Jiang Zemin
and Hu Jintao. In 2001, China
[05:08] joined the World Trade Organization, a
defining moment in modern economic history
[05:12] that expanded Chinese goods access
to global markets.
[05:15] In exchange for China's
commitment to economic liberalization
[05:18] along international principles, China's
GDP per capita surged
[05:22] by another five fold in the ten years
following its accession to the WTO,
[05:26] and merchandise exports jumped to account
for around 60% of GDP by 2007.
[05:32] Cheap Chinese goods
flooded into foreign markets, and China
[05:34] started to build up large trade surpluses
with the rest of the world.
[05:38] On the back of this export-
led growth, China officially overtook
[05:41] Japan as the world's
second largest economy in 2010.
[05:45] But despite all this, China's export
economy remained largely
[05:48] focused on lower end labor-
intensive manufacturing.
[05:51] Back in Shenzhen, Wang had diversified
BYD's business, acquiring a struggling
[05:55] car company to enter the auto industry
with its strength in producing
[05:59] rechargeable batteries.
[06:00] The company looked at producing hybrid
and electric vehicles in China.
[06:04] However, it was still not a major player
on the global market.
[06:07] In 2010, it ranked
just 26th in vehicle production worldwide,
[06:11] far behind industry
giants like GM, Volkswagen and Toyota.
[06:15] The top spots were still dominated
by the familiar names
[06:18] from the US, Germany and Japan.
[06:20] And while the Chinese firms were gaining
traction in the production of other clean
[06:24] energy technologies like solar panels,
domestic usage remained minuscule.
[06:28] In 2010, 80% of the country's
electricity came from burning coal.
[06:34] 30 years after Deng Xiaoping came to
power, China was a changed country.
[06:38] They had moved from being a poor, closed
agricultural society to a fast developing
[06:43] global manufacturing hub built mostly on
exporting cheap, labor-intensive goods.
[06:49] Wang, the BYD boss, set a goal:
the company would be the world's
[06:53] largest car producer by 2025,
but this remained a distant hope.
[06:59] The economy was still rooted in dirty,
low-tech manufacturing
[07:03] and relied heavily on other countries
for high-end products.
[07:06] If China wanted to become a superpower,
this had to change.
[07:13] President XI Jinping came to power in 2012
with a vision
[07:17] to remake China
as a superpower, to chase a China dream.
[07:21] So in 2015, they announced a new economic
[07:24] strategy: Made in China 2025,
[07:27] designed as a blueprint for the next stage
of China's economic development.
[07:31] It outlined the weaknesses of China's
economy and set out goals
[07:34] to eliminate them.
[07:35] It said that China's manufacturing
industry was large but not strong,
[07:39] lacked innovation, and was dependent
on foreign countries for core technologies
[07:43] and high-end equipment.
[07:45] It also identified key sectors
for the country's
[07:47] future as a manufacturing powerhouse,
including robotics, aerospace,
[07:51] biotech, electric vehicles
and renewable energy technology.
[07:54] The document was a clear directive
for the state to back
[07:57] key modern industries that had begun
emerging in the early 2010s.
[08:01] So ten years on in 2025, where are we?
[08:05] To put it simply, China now dominates
the global clean energy supply chain.
[08:10] In the first five months
of this year, China installed
[08:13] 244GW of new solar
and wind energy capacity.
[08:18] That's about equal to more than 100
solar panels every second,
[08:22] and enough to power Indonesia
or Turkey entirely.
[08:26] Chinese green technology companies
such as BYD, Longi Solar and Goldwind
[08:30] are world class, both in terms of cost
and product innovation.
[08:35] BYD is now the third largest
auto brand by cars produced,
[08:39] and China now buys more electric cars
than conventional gasoline ones.
[08:43] And it exports this dominance globally.
[08:46] China accounts for 80% of global
solar panel production capacity.
[08:50] It represents 60% of global wind
turbine production
[08:53] and up to 90% of global
lithium battery production.
[08:57] BYD has established factories in Brazil,
Hungary, Thailand and Turkey,
[09:02] supplying electric vehicles
directly to local markets in each region.
[09:06] And to top it all off, China's trade
surplus was almost $1 trillion.
[09:11] There is no escaping it.
[09:13] China is winning the global
industrial arms race. Real quick.
[09:17] We started a discord community
where you can
[09:18] submit ideas, ask us questions,
or even debate us.
[09:21] It's free and you can find the link
in the description.
[09:24] Now back to the video.
[09:28] To put it simply, Chinese
[09:29] technology companies are now
among the most competitive in the world.
[09:32] But they didn't get there on their own.
[09:34] From start to finish,
[09:35] they've had extensive support
from the Chinese government.
[09:38] In 2019 alone, the most recent year
with reliable data,
[09:42] the government shelled out $400 billion
in industrial support spending.
[09:46] The spending takes many forms.
[09:48] Most obviously, there are straightforward
direct subsidies.
[09:51] China introduced purchase subsidies
for electric vehicles in 2009,
[09:55] and only phased them out
at a national level in 2022,
[09:58] paid directly to the car producer.
[10:00] The average direct subsidy
per vehicle has fallen over time,
[10:03] from around $2700 per vehicle in 2010
[10:06] to $1500 in 2022,
but the aggregate amount has grown,
[10:09] surging to a whopping
$5 billion in its final year in 2022.
[10:14] For example, BYD alone
received 3.7 billion in subsidies
[10:18] between 2018 and 2022, including
[10:21] 2.2 billion in 22 alone.
[10:24] Meanwhile, two of China's largest wind
turbine manufacturers,
[10:28] Goldwind and Mingyang, received
more than 160 million
[10:31] each in direct subsidies between
2018 and 22.
[10:35] What's more, renewable
energy plants in China until this year
[10:38] enjoyed preferential pricing
under a nationwide feed-in tariff,
[10:42] where they were paid more per unit
of electricity than coal producers.
[10:46] And while it no longer exists
on a national scale,
[10:49] certain large provinces
still offer similar schemes.
[10:52] Although direct subsidies are a big part,
comprising around 22% of industrial
[10:56] spending analyzed in
the study, it’s far from the full picture.
[11:00] China provides tax incentives and credits
to help these companies grow and operate,
[11:04] and to enable their R&D.
[11:06] It can provide them with cheap land
and manage the prices of other input costs
[11:10] like electricity.
[11:11] Earlier this year, for example, Jiangsu
province, one of the country's richest,
[11:15] cut industrial power prices
by 9% to support local industry margins.
[11:19] And in fact, the largest way it supports
these companies is by offering
[11:22] cheap loans.
[11:23] China has a highly centralized
banking sector, with state-
[11:27] owned banks owning
60% of all assets in the sector.
[11:30] This means they can lend extensively
to help favored industries grow,
[11:33] calculated not by risk and return,
but by the government's own priorities.
[11:38] According to central bank data, new bank
lending to China's manufacturing sector
[11:42] has surged in recent years as the government
has sought to pivot the engine of growth
[11:46] away from the property sector
to high-end manufacturing.
[11:49] Lastly, there are several forms
of industrial support
[11:52] that are unique to China.
[11:53] The large share of state-owned enterprises
in the economy means that they can use
[11:56] bulk procurement of new products
[11:58] by these companies
to support the industry's early expansion.
[12:01] BYD, for example, received the world's
largest public bus lease tender
[12:05] for electric busses in 2011
from the Shenzhen government.
[12:08] And government-owned investment
vehicles can step in to provide equity
[12:12] funding in key industries, acting
almost like venture capital investors.
[12:15] In 2020, the city government of Hefei
in Anhui province, directed
[12:19] local investment vehicles to buy a 24%
stake in EV producer
[12:24] NIO for $1 billion,
essentially to bail them out.
[12:28] All of this means that Chinese companies
can operate and produce more cheaply.
[12:31] They have lower rent
costs, lower tax burden, lower borrowing
[12:34] costs and subsidized
demand in their massive domestic market.
[12:38] Take the EV example.
[12:39] Between 2009 and 2017,
China's EV industry received $61
[12:44] billion in government support,
with 80% of this in the form of direct
[12:48] subsidies and tax exemptions,
12% in government procurement
[12:52] and around 3% from R&D grants
and infrastructure subsidies.
[12:56] Altogether, government support
covered around 23%
[12:59] of the cost of a new vehicle in 2018,
or $13,000.
[13:04] Xi Jinping's Made in China
strategy was built on massive state
[13:07] support from start to finish,
and the West can't compete.
[13:15] China's dominance of the global renewable
[13:17] supply chain has become one of the most
controversial issues in global trade.
[13:20] The flooding of cheap Chinese exports
of solar panels, EVs and wind turbines
[13:25] have led to calls from trade partners
to introduce tariffs
[13:28] and other protectionist measures
to keep them out.
[13:30] In 2024,
the US Treasury secretary even warned
[13:34] that Chinese exports risked
decimating American industry.
[13:38] Take solar panels, for example.
[13:40] Exports of solar panels in capacity
terms have increased sevenfold since 2017,
[13:45] but the average price
has collapsed by more than 60%.
[13:48] The Chinese government
would respond to this by saying
[13:50] that their industries are simply more
competitive than those abroad,
[13:54] and point out that other countries
also subsidize these industries.
[13:58] And this is undeniably true.
[13:59] Just take a look at Tesla,
[14:01] which benefits from generous tax credits
from the US government.
[14:04] But there are two differences
between government support in China
[14:07] and the rest of the world.
[14:09] The first is in the sheer
scale of Beijing's industrial support.
[14:12] China's industrial support
spending in 2019 totaled 1.7% of its GDP.
[14:18] That's more than double
the level of support given in South Korea,
[14:21] and four times the relative amount
in the USA and Germany.
[14:25] But second, China is different
in that its development
[14:27] model is built around
the supply side of the economy.
[14:30] This is where the concept of overcapacity
comes in.
[14:33] For decades, China has distributed
resources into productive capacity
[14:37] rather than to households.
[14:39] Instead of building
extensive social welfare,
[14:42] allowing incomes for Chinese workers
to increase substantially,
[14:45] or allowing the yuan to appreciate.
it has focused on investment
[14:49] into roads, airports, train lines,
industrial capacity and research.
[14:54] And it has kept the yuan weak to help
sell this capacity overseas.
[14:58] That means two things.
[14:59] First,
[15:00] it means that production costs are cheaper
at every stage of the supply chain.
[15:04] So if you're making EVs, for example, it's
not just that BYD get support
[15:08] from government subsidies and loans,
it's all the things
[15:10] they need to make the cars - from tires
to windshields to plastic,
[15:14] they're all produced
extremely cheaply at home.
[15:18] And on the other side of the coin.
[15:20] It means that Chinese consumers spend less
and save a higher proportion
[15:23] of their income.
[15:24] As a result, they consume
less of the goods produced in the economy.
[15:28] In 2023, consumption
accounted for only 40% of Chinese GDP,
[15:32] versus a global average of 57%.
[15:35] Both of these mean that China produces
more than it consumes
[15:38] and exports this abroad
in the form of a large trade surplus.
[15:41] And according to Deutsche Bank, China
represents 32% of global manufacturing
[15:46] but only 12% of consumption,
for example, in 2023.
[15:50] China had enough
solar panel production capacity
[15:53] to produce 861GW of solar panel modules.
[15:57] But here's the kicker.
[15:58] Global demand
that year was less than half that.
[16:01] This overcapacity
scenario pushes down the prices.
[16:04] And so all this production is actually
bad news for industry in China and abroad.
[16:09] Chinese factories are losing money
as they pace, insane
[16:11] levels of domestic competition
and limited domestic demand.
[16:15] If you look at the share price
of the country's
[16:17] major renewable energy companies
like Longi Solar, Ming
[16:20] Yang and Trina Solar,
they're all down in the dumps.
[16:24] So the issue isn't as simple as being a
zero-sum game between China and the world.
[16:28] It isn't as simple
as who pays more in subsidies.
[16:30] It's about the overall structure
of the Chinese economy.
[16:33] That's something that no amount of tariffs
or angry rhetoric will change.
[16:40] From an economic
perspective, the conclusion is clear.
[16:43] Beijing has built an economic system
that favors industrial capacity
[16:47] above all else.
[16:48] China's
dominance in new energy is state-directed,
[16:51] state-subsidized, and state-
supported every step of the way.
[16:54] This has created world
[16:55] class, innovative companies
that can produce much more cheaply
[16:59] than foreign companies.
[17:00] But without true exposure to market
forces.
[17:02] Chinese factories produce
[17:04] so much that both companies at home
and abroad struggle to make money.
[17:08] And this has become the root of China's
[17:09] trade argument with the United States
and other trade partners.
[17:13] That perhaps the debate
over the fairness of China's trade
[17:15] dominance and overcapacity misses
a crucial point.
[17:19] China now churns out loads of cheap and
high quality renewable energy technology.
[17:24] While that may be bad news for Tesla,
as well as for many of those loss-making
[17:27] Chinese companies, it's good news
for global consumers who pay lower prices.
[17:32] And it's good news
[17:33] most importantly for the environment,
because we can all buy EVs, solar panels
[17:38] and other forms of renewable energy
more cheaply.
[17:41] But the question for you is,
[17:43] do you want to live in a world
where the car
[17:44] you drive, the battery in your phone,
and the solar panels
[17:48] that keep your lights on all
come from China?
[17:51] Put differently,
[17:52] does it matter
if the cat is white or black?
