[00:05] >> Today, as China's school year begins,
[00:07] students as young as six will be
[00:09] studying artificial intelligence.
[00:11] >> It's a starting point for them to be
[00:14] able to
[00:16] be comfortable with the idea of
[00:17] artificial intelligence from a really
[00:19] young age.
[00:20] >> What lessons does this experiment hold
[00:22] for students? And what will it mean for
[00:24] China's future as the global tech race
[00:27] rages on? I'm Malikica Vilal and this is
[00:30] The Take.

[01:04] >> I'm Katrina U. I am the correspondent
[01:06] for Alazer English in China, based in
[01:09] Beijing.
[01:11] >> And you are talking to me very late in
[01:14] Beijing right now. Indeed,
[01:17] it is 11 p.m.
[01:18] >> Well, Katrina, it is great to have you
[01:20] on the take. This September, China is
[01:24] doing something it hasn't done before.
[01:26] Children as young as 6 years old will be
[01:29] trained in artificial intelligence
[01:30] literacy. So, it begs the question, what
[01:34] does that look like in the classroom?
[01:38] >> Right. Well, China is strongly
[01:41] encouraging AI education for not just
[01:44] six-year-olds, but as soon as you start
[01:46] school to the end, a program of AI
[01:49] literacy. Obviously, you just start, you
[01:51] can't, you know, you're at school, you
[01:53] can't read. And so, it's not really
[01:55] about getting these kids to have a deep
[01:58] knowledge of AI, but it's about sparking
[02:00] their interest in AI. What does that
[02:03] look like? I guess most likely bringing
[02:06] them maybe to a robot convention,
[02:08] showing them videos of robots, talking
[02:10] to them about how they might be helpful
[02:12] in their lives, in their families, in
[02:14] their households, and in the country.
[02:17] And the aim is that these six-year-olds
[02:20] will one day grow up and be very good
[02:24] users of AI.
[02:26] >> That's the hope. Yeah.
[02:28] >> Mhm. So six-year-olds will grow up and
[02:31] totally know how artificial intelligence
[02:33] works. But for the secondary schoolers,
[02:36] middle schoolers, high schoolers, this
[02:38] is about what ethics, right and wrong.
[02:41] What do you think is happening there?
[02:45] So we don't know what AI education is
[02:48] going and AI is going to look like in
[02:50] the next 10 years but
[02:53] when you get into middle school now
[02:55] you'll be able to use different
[02:56] applications you know chat bots uh
[02:59] different visual applications on the
[03:01] phone you'll also be learning about the
[03:03] ethics of AI you'll be learning about
[03:05] privacy social responsibility issues
[03:09] you'll be learning the basics about what
[03:11] goes in the back end of AI and the
[03:13] higher levels of high school that you
[03:14] get, you'll learn about what goes into
[03:16] actually making that. And I'm sure the
[03:19] hope from the Chinese government's point
[03:22] of view will be that some of these kids
[03:24] will grow up and be AI engineers or
[03:26] contribute to AI in some form or
[03:30] fashion.
[03:31] >> Okay. So, you talked about the potential
[03:33] hope there. In April, China's President
[03:36] Xiinping spoke about AI as a strategic
[03:39] technology.
[03:41] General Secretary Xin Ping noted that
[03:43] the party central committee attaches
[03:45] great importance to the development of
[03:47] AI. The CPC has improved the top level
[03:50] design and strengthened implementation
[03:52] efforts in recent years. Why do you
[03:55] think there is such an emphasis on AI in
[03:58] China?
[04:00] Xiinping has made it his mission to
[04:02] achieve this great rejuvenation of China
[04:05] by the year 2049 which basically means
[04:07] he wants China to be really advanced,
[04:11] prosperous, he calls it modern socialist
[04:14] society and Xiinping believes artificial
[04:18] intelligence is crucial to getting to
[04:21] that goal. Somehow whoever is able to
[04:25] really use AI will be one of the most
[04:30] powerful, most advanced, most
[04:32] influential countries in the world. And
[04:34] he believes that so strongly that he
[04:37] doesn't want to leave it to market
[04:39] forces. He genuinely believes that the
[04:42] state is responsible for doing what it
[04:44] can to get its country there. So that's
[04:47] why we're seeing all this investment.
[04:49] That's why we're seeing these education
[04:50] mandates. Um, so that's one part of it.
[04:54] I think the other part is that Xiinping
[04:56] as a leader since he's come to power,
[04:58] it's been really evident that he's kind
[05:00] of obsessed with narratives. And
[05:02] artificial intelligence, as we know, is
[05:06] not just this objective entity that will
[05:10] speak the truth or whatever that is. It
[05:12] is imbued with the ideas, the
[05:15] philosophies, the histories, the
[05:17] ideologies of whoever creates it. And
[05:21] we're seeing people go to chat dpt or
[05:24] these chat bots for not just not using
[05:26] it as Google as you for direction in
[05:29] their life. They're having an influence
[05:31] on people. So Xiinping
[05:33] also is conscious of China as not just a
[05:37] rival with Western countries when it
[05:40] comes to the economic sphere,
[05:43] geopolitical sphere, the military
[05:44] sphere. It's also an old rivalry with
[05:47] countries like the US when it comes to
[05:49] ideas. And one of the things that
[05:50] artificial intelligence does is it it
[05:52] powers these large language models. So I
[05:56] think China also wants to make sure that
[05:58] it is in the AI game writing its own
[06:02] LLMs and playing a part in contributing
[06:06] to that world narrative. And that is
[06:08] also part of the mission I think. Well,
[06:11] you mentioned the rivalry there. In the
[06:14] US, 250 CEOs, including the heads of
[06:17] LinkedIn, Uber, Salesforce, signed an
[06:20] open letter to lawmakers criticizing the
[06:23] US for not doing something similar to
[06:25] what we're seeing roll out in China. So,
[06:29] you've talked about why this is so
[06:30] important to China being the narrative.
[06:33] But when I think of narrative, I'm
[06:34] imagining a bunch of squirmy
[06:37] six-year-olds. Instead of using crayons
[06:40] to color, they are using AI to generate
[06:43] things from their imagination, pictures
[06:45] of their home and what they did that
[06:47] day. There's no more coloring outside
[06:48] the lines because AI has got it. Is
[06:50] there conversation online in China about
[06:53] what this will look like? Will it look
[06:55] like that?
[06:57] I think when we look at the guidelines
[07:00] that the government released about this
[07:02] strongly urging the AI uh a AI to be in
[07:07] Chinese curriculum, they specifically
[07:09] say that they don't want AI to be
[07:12] thinking for the kids. They want them to
[07:14] be able to use AI without those things.
[07:18] But it's kind of difficult, right?
[07:20] because you're teaching kids about how
[07:21] useful this is, how great this is. But
[07:23] no, no, don't don't you don't use it.
[07:26] Just I'm just, you know, telling you an
[07:28] app. This is a thing the rest of the
[07:30] world will have to kind of figure out
[07:31] like how are we going to teach our
[07:34] children how to use AI without it
[07:36] harming their ability to think for
[07:38] themselves. And what I'm seeing from the
[07:40] Chinese government especially is this
[07:42] very conscious move to make sure that
[07:46] that population kind of embrace AI that
[07:51] they're not scared of it that they will
[07:52] see it as a positive.
[07:55] >> Well, Katrina, you have reported on how
[07:58] the Chinese government is pouring
[08:00] billions into not just AI development
[08:03] but also into the creation of robotics
[08:06] that can run that AI. And you got to see
[08:09] this up close and personal at the World
[08:11] Robotics Conference in Beijing.
[08:13] >> Yeah.
[08:14] >> I've seen a video of you exploring this
[08:17] conference and it's really quite
[08:19] something to see. So tell us about what
[08:20] you saw or should I say who you met.
[08:25] >> Um 200 companies were presenting their
[08:28] robots at this conference and the theme
[08:31] was embodied intelligence. So, you know,
[08:34] a lot of us, many of us may have
[08:36] chatbots on our phone, but it's about
[08:38] giving those chatbots a body, human or
[08:42] animal or otherwise. And so, first of
[08:46] what impressed me was the scale of this.
[08:50] [Music]
[08:54] >> They had fighting robots in a boxing
[08:56] ring. They had robots that were playing
[08:58] the drums, playing the piano, making
[09:00] coffee, serving popcorn. They had
[09:04] freakily human looking robots, you know,
[09:07] with like the silicon skin that that is,
[09:11] you know, with the hair, with the eye
[09:13] movements. You know, in China, there are
[09:16] hundreds of companies creating humanoid
[09:20] robots to do all sorts of things. One of
[09:23] the robots that impressed me was a robot
[09:24] that has been designed by UB Tech and
[09:27] their robots are being used in some
[09:29] electric vehicle factories in China. And
[09:32] they have now come up with a robot that
[09:34] can change its own battery. Like it
[09:37] literally takes a battery out of its
[09:40] back while still having another battery.
[09:42] It knows when its battery is low. It
[09:44] replaces it and then it goes on working.
[09:47] So
[09:47] >> incredible. There is now a worker, a
[09:49] factory worker that doesn't rest,
[09:51] doesn't sleep,
[09:52] >> doesn't take breaks, doesn't eat,
[09:54] doesn't complain, can work 247.
[09:58] So that's like something I thought was
[10:02] only in movies, but that's already
[10:04] happening. Another thing that surprised
[10:06] me is there were so many kids at this
[10:08] thing and it was geared towards kids.
[10:11] You know, the first time my
[10:13] three-year-old saw a robot was in person
[10:16] was at the mall. this like dog looking
[10:18] robot. And the first thing my
[10:20] three-year-old did was freak out because
[10:22] like
[10:22] >> it's animal, but it's not quite an. But
[10:25] the more you see it, the more you
[10:26] interact with it, the more you get used
[10:28] to it, the more um
[10:32] interested you are and welcoming of this
[10:34] kind of technology. Potentially that
[10:36] humanoid robot could be walking their
[10:38] dog and cooking their food at home. It
[10:40] could be
[10:41] >> not teaching them at school, but it
[10:43] could be like the assistant teacher at
[10:45] their school one day. Who knows?
[10:48] >> As the technology increases, they can
[10:50] become much more lifelike. So, it won't
[10:53] feel like they're an anomaly, this
[10:55] robotic thing that's like a human or
[10:58] that's like an animal. You actually
[11:00] spoke to one who's not quite there yet.
[11:03] Tell me about that that exchange.
[11:06] >> So, um I just wanted to have a
[11:09] conversation. I said, "I'm Katrina
[11:12] >> from Alazera."
[11:14] And then I waited for a response maybe
[11:16] five seconds. It was thinking, you know,
[11:18] it was like thinking.
[11:19] >> Nice to meet you too, Katrina. It's
[11:22] great to connect with a journalist from
[11:23] Algeria.
[11:24] >> It's great to meet a journalist from
[11:26] Algeria.
[11:28] >> So,
[11:30] not quite. I mean, and then I corrected
[11:32] it and then it apologized to me. So,
[11:34] that was nice. But the technology, who
[11:36] knows, 5 years from now, that that could
[11:38] have been a much smoother conversation.
[11:41] and it was a warm tone. That's obviously
[11:44] not the most advanced. I'm sure some
[11:47] company in the back of their warehouse
[11:49] has some secret project that's even more
[11:51] advanced going on. And so there is so
[11:53] much investment. I've covered so many AI
[11:56] stories. For me, I feel like AI is
[11:59] >> it's such a huge thing. And this analyst
[12:02] I was talking to, she says, you know,
[12:04] there is no other government that is so
[12:06] enthusiastic as China in really making a
[12:10] bet on AI. They are really hoping this
[12:13] is going to pay off because if you look
[12:15] at other governments, especially in the
[12:17] West, they're actually kind of afraid
[12:18] because they are are afraid of the
[12:20] impact this is going to have on their
[12:21] labor force. They're afraid of people
[12:24] losing their jobs. And so they're
[12:26] they're kind of just tentative, maybe
[12:28] wait and see. in some cases even holding
[12:31] back with AI. But China is going all in.
[12:34] So one of the reasons for that is that
[12:36] China is in the middle of a demographic
[12:38] crisis, aging population. There is a
[12:40] concern that the labor force that
[12:42] powered its
[12:44] breakneck economic growth that that era
[12:47] could quickly end. And I think they're
[12:50] also hoping that the solution to that
[12:53] will be AI could be humanoid robots in
[12:57] factories instead of the millions of
[13:00] people who now power those industries.
[13:04] We'll have more with Katrina after the
[13:06] break.
[13:10] You know, Katrina, you and I um through
[13:12] so much of this conversation are being
[13:14] kind of jovial because so much of this
[13:16] conversation feels very sci-fi and feels
[13:19] fun and and light. There's also another
[13:22] sector where AI is increasingly being
[13:25] used and that has people nervous and
[13:28] that is in warfare. So a big part of any
[13:31] country's identity is its military and
[13:33] we know that President Xi has also vowed
[13:36] to have a worldclass military by 2050.
[13:40] How does China talk about AI when it
[13:43] comes to conflict? I think Xiinping has
[13:47] made it very clear that AI is going to
[13:50] play a crucial role in China's military,
[13:53] not just tomorrow, but but today. We
[13:55] just had in Beijing, the whole city shut
[13:58] down for this massive military parade on
[14:00] September the 3rd, which was marking the
[14:02] end of World War II. The crowd of more
[14:05] than 50,000 waved Chinese flags,
[14:07] cheering as thousands of soldiers
[14:10] marched in perfect unison. Several
[14:12] hundred ground weapon systems on
[14:14] display. over 100 aircraft,
[14:17] >> lots of soldiers goostepping. It was a
[14:20] spectacle and a lot of military
[14:22] analysts. The messages that I got
[14:24] afterwards were really remarking on not
[14:28] only the advanced tanks, the advanced
[14:30] jets, the advanced hypersonic missiles,
[14:32] but so many different types of drones,
[14:34] so many different types of unmanned um
[14:37] ships, unmanned um submarine vehicles.
[14:42] The phrase that I heard was that the
[14:43] army of the future is the army of no man
[14:46] and that the future of warfare could be
[14:49] fought with all of these unmanned
[14:52] vehicles. And one analyst I spoke to
[14:53] said, "Well, if you remove the person
[14:56] from a ship, then you don't need to
[14:58] worry about defending the ship or arming
[15:00] it in a certain way. It really just
[15:02] changes the game. You have um you can
[15:05] have all these vehicles. You can have
[15:07] these have a swarm attack. AI will be
[15:11] used in the way that a battlefield is
[15:13] scanned in surveillance and
[15:14] reconnaissance in early warning. It can
[15:17] be used in training
[15:19] I think is also begging the question of
[15:22] other governments and I mean the kind of
[15:25] investments they're making in their
[15:27] military are they making the right
[15:30] investments or should they also be
[15:32] thinking about a war that can be fought
[15:34] with all these unmanned technologies?
[15:37] >> Yeah. Well, Katrina, at the same time,
[15:40] there's also another battle. We touched
[15:42] on this earlier, but I want to dive in a
[15:44] little deeper here, and that is about
[15:46] the battle for dominance in AI
[15:50] specifically when it comes to the
[15:53] technology that powers it. So, AI chips,
[15:55] can you tell us a little bit about
[15:56] those?
[15:58] Well, not being engineer an engineer. I
[16:01] think in simple terms,
[16:03] AI requires a lot of computing power and
[16:06] the US had control over the creation of
[16:10] the best semiconductors. If you think of
[16:13] companies like Nvidia for example at the
[16:15] forefront of this kind of technology,
[16:19] I think there was a recognition from the
[16:22] previous US Biden administration that
[16:26] maybe they shouldn't be sending their
[16:28] best semiconductors to China because one
[16:31] day they could be used at China's
[16:33] arrival could be used against the US
[16:35] militarily. And so they started
[16:37] systematically restricting the access of
[16:41] semiconductors to the Chinese market.
[16:44] Now at the beginning that was quite
[16:46] devastating for Chinese companies who
[16:48] relied on this kind of technology.
[16:51] But it has also spurred the Chinese
[16:54] government
[16:56] to really be on a mission for
[16:58] self-reliance
[16:59] to realize hey maybe we shouldn't be
[17:02] relying on the US for something that is
[17:03] so important to our mission and our
[17:05] future. maybe we should create a
[17:06] homegrown industry. And that is exactly
[17:09] what China has done. And it's been slow,
[17:12] painful, and expensive. But China now is
[17:16] progressing in the creation of its own
[17:18] semiconductors.
[17:20] And I think you have the creation or the
[17:24] founding of companies like Deepseek that
[17:29] suddenly came on the global stage
[17:31] seemingly out of nowhere earlier this
[17:33] year. Deepseek caused those ripples in
[17:36] the US because Deepseek is a Chinese
[17:39] artificial intelligence company
[17:40] >> and it has emerged as a real player in
[17:43] the AI arms race. It's called Deep Seek
[17:47] and investors and I would imagine
[17:49] officials in Washington are stunned to
[17:51] learn that Deep Seek's AI model has
[17:54] developed technology that can actually
[17:56] be competitive with Open AI and Google
[17:58] and XAI and all these more established
[18:01] players. and it freaked out the stock
[18:04] market and the whole tech industry in
[18:06] the United States because it really
[18:08] challenged this narrative. So
[18:11] >> China has now
[18:13] >> got an industry that many experts would
[18:16] acknowledge that yes it is still behind
[18:19] the US but maybe it's not as far behind
[18:22] as we thought and some nationalist
[18:24] commentators on in China say actually
[18:28] thank you to the US thank you to the
[18:30] Biden administration for doing that
[18:32] because that really lit a fire under the
[18:35] bottom of policy makers in China and
[18:37] they're not going to need to go to
[18:40] anyone else for semiconductors to power
[18:42] their AI dreams of the future.
[18:45] >> AI dreams of the future. So Katrina,
[18:48] before we go, you and I have a couple of
[18:51] things in common and that is that we are
[18:53] both elder millennials and we both have
[18:57] young kids who are not quite school age
[19:00] yet but will be soon. and your kids are
[19:04] growing up in a world where AI will be
[19:08] something they learn most likely in
[19:11] school.
[19:12] When you think of their future, do you
[19:14] ever wonder how different it will be
[19:16] from
[19:17] the upbringing that you had
[19:22] >> all the time? I think it's already so
[19:25] different. Technology is such a huge
[19:27] part of our lives and I wonder
[19:35] what kind of part it's going to play in
[19:37] their future when they grow up, what
[19:39] kind of jobs they're going to have. And
[19:42] I think there's like two sides of the
[19:44] coin. And my husband and I talk about
[19:46] this all the time. He's kind of the
[19:48] pessimistic, oh no,
[19:52] of kind of not panicking, but a little
[19:55] worried about what their future is going
[19:57] to look like. I'm choosing to be
[19:59] optimistic.
[20:01] I'm hoping that whatever world they grow
[20:03] up with, a in with AI, that it's going
[20:05] to free up their time to be more
[20:09] creative, to be more expressive, that it
[20:11] will celebrate the things that make them
[20:13] human, that it might take away jobs.
[20:16] sure that are process oriented,
