======================================================================

[00:00] Luke here at the Outdoor Boys YouTube channel and I'm stranded in the wilderness of Alaska. For the last three days, I've been solo camping in Alaska's
[00:06] rainforest. I've used float planes, canoes, and my own two feet in order to explore remote hot springs. But my plane
[00:13] was supposed to pick me up this morning, and it didn't show up. I'm not sure how I'm going to get home. But one thing's
[00:18] for sure, this is going to be an interesting video. [Music]
[00:29] There's one. [Music]
[00:49] Heat. Heat. [Music]
[01:06] [Music]
[01:14] [Music]
[01:19] Thank you. Thank you.
[01:25] [Applause] Well, I'm all by myself now.
[01:42] I've got lots of different ammo. I've got slugs for bears and I've got birdshot. It's a nice thing about shotguns. They're versatile.
[01:52] There we go. Just going to leave my gun case in the bushes. I'll get it on my way back. Well, guys, welcome to the
[01:58] temperate rainforests of Southeast Alaska. It rains over 270 days out of
[02:03] the year here. And we're about 45 miles northnortheast of Catch Can, Alaska.
[02:10] All right, we better get trucking. Got a long way to go.
[02:18] Look at this place. It's a cold jungle. Everything is covered in moss.
[02:33] Look at the size of this log. This is crazy.
[03:02] Look at this.
[03:12] That's pretty cool. Well, this is the lake I was trying to find. Unfortunately, I'm on the wrong
[03:19] end of the lake. And it's a big lake. Sure is pretty.
[03:25] Hold on. There's a little something over there.
[03:33] Check it out. It's an old trolley. All the woods rotted away, but you can
[03:39] still see the metal frame.
[03:49] Oh, that is slick. You see the trolley pretty good here. I think normally the
[03:54] water level's a little bit lower and you can walk out to that thing, but hey, I got a great view of the lake.
[04:08] Look at this.
[04:14] Looks a little beat up. National Forest Service left these
[04:19] canoes here for anybody to use. As long as you take care of them, put them back where you found them, everyone can enjoy
[04:25] them. It's a real great thing.
[04:41] Woohoo.
[04:48] You know what? Rain or no rain, this is still pretty cool. Look at this.
[04:59] There's a couple ducks right over there. I think I might go get them.
[05:06] Oh, there they go. Well, they didn't let me get close to them, but they're here, and that's a good sign. If I get up
[05:12] early tomorrow morning, I think I might have a good chance at him.
[05:33] There we go. We got ourselves a nice little shelter. Going to need it cuz I've already wet my pants.
[05:44] Well, this is a pretty slick little shelter. It was built in 1937, so it's
[05:49] almost 90 years old. Just made with logs and cedar shingles. Got a nice little shelf up here you can sleep on or use
[05:56] for storage. Look at a big old solid benches here. Got even a little bit of wood here I
[06:03] might be able to chop up. This is a pretty cool spot, but I got to get my tent set up. I am really wet and cold.
[06:31] Well, check this out. It's a volcanic hotring. Look at all the
[06:37] steam coming off this water. Oh, that's warm.
[06:50] See if we can jam this hole up. There we go. It's filling up with hot
[06:55] water pretty quick. Scalding hot right there.
[07:02] This right here must be the source. Woo! Yeah, that's boiling. This over
[07:09] here is just warm. You can see all the steam coming off the hillside. There's
[07:14] probably other hot springs popping out higher up there. Now, there's a hose over there bringing hot water down the
[07:20] hill. We got to figure out why it's not working.
[07:30] There we go.
[07:38] Woo, that's hot. All right, so we got cold water there, boiling hot water
[07:44] there, and warm water flowing in here. And you can kind of use the three to adjust your temperature. Oh man, I want
[07:51] to jump in this right now, but it's getting dark and I am getting hungry and I need to give this some time to clean
[07:58] out the pool and get it nice and warm. [Applause] Woo!
[08:03] That is so awesome. I think the only thing that could be more exciting than that is a hot meal. Oh, I am so hungry.
[08:24] These broughtwur are pre-cooked, so you just want to warm them up. Really, put a little bit of water in the bottom of the
[08:29] frying pan. Bring it to a boil. By the time the water evaporates, the broughtwur is piping hot through and
[08:35] through.
[08:44] Oh, that's delicious. It's not fancy, but it's warm and it's quick. Two things
[08:49] I really appreciate right now. There you go.
[08:55] [Music]
[09:05] I'll tell you what, guys. I am exhausted. I had to get up at 5:30 in the morning to catch my flight. Spent
[09:10] all day on a plane and then had to hurry as fast I could to get here before sunset. Didn't even have time to eat
[09:16] lunch.
[09:34] Got my hot water bottle here. Check for leaks. All right, looks good. Let's put that in
[09:40] there. Well, I got some bread flour with me. And tomorrow morning, I'm going to eat hot fresh bread. So, I'm going to go
[09:46] ahead and mix up a little water with it. Give it a little mix. Let it sit overnight and it'll be fermented and all
[09:51] ready to go tomorrow morning. Making fresh bread is one of my favorite things to eat on a camp out. And I get
[09:57] people asking me all the time how you do it. I did an entire video on how to make campfire bread. It's really easy.
[10:05] Just going to hang it up on this clothes line so mice can't get at it. Well, I think I am ready to get out of these wet
[10:12] clothes. All right.
[10:19] Well, the sun set about an hour ago and it's only 7:15. It is getting dark so
[10:25] early nowadays. I'm just going to kind of hop into bed and eat some snacks and listen to an
[10:31] audio book. I've got a pumpkin pie infused Gouda cheese, which is going to be kind of wild. Got some chocolate
[10:37] covered hazelnuts, a wicked salami, fig cake, and some pilot bread. So, yes, I'm
[10:44] having an awesome time.
[10:52] Sun's just barely up and it's not raining. So, I think I should go do some duck hunting. Oh, yeah. These didn't dry
[10:59] out at all last night. This is not going to be fun.
[11:11] That flock of ducks is right back where they were yesterday. I'm going to try to stalk them.
[11:18] Oh, there's about 15 ducks in that flock and they flew off before I even got half as close as I needed to be. But I'm sure
[11:24] they're not the only duck on this lake. Malard ducks actually have a language of
[11:30] sorts. There's a hey baby, I'm here call.
[11:37] There's that num num this is tasty call. There's the basic quack.
[11:53] Well, that duck came right into the call and I was able to close the distance with him pretty good. When I got closer,
[11:58] I could tell he wasn't a malard. He's some sort of diving duck. And those usually don't taste as good as malards.
[12:04] So, I'm just going to kind of let that one go.
[12:10] [Music] I'm just working my way up and down this river and around the lake just looking
[12:17] for sloohs and marshy spots.
[12:35] Oh, my legs.
[12:43] Well, I spent about three hours paddling around looking for ducks. Didn't shoot any. And oh, I am tired and hungry. I
[12:50] think I am ready for breakfast.
[13:03] Little something to keep me warm while I cook.
[13:11] [Music]
[13:27] Got a little butter and honey in this jar. We're going to let that warm up.
[13:35] Pour some honey butter on that. Some fresh pan fried bread with honey butter and pork gel bacon.
[13:54] Few things in the world taste better than fresh homemade bread smothered in melted butter and honey. Well, I'll tell
[14:00] you what, the rain has eased up a little bit. I want to take advantage of that. I want to go get some firewood and bring
[14:06] it into the shelter so it can dry off a little bit. And maybe, just maybe, I can build a fire tonight. If nothing else,
[14:12] cutting firewood will keep me warm.
[14:35] Look at that. There's water all the way through that log.
[14:52] There we go. Got a nice pile of wet wood. It's mostly dry on the inside, but it's so wet on the outside, it's going
[14:58] to take a lot of heat to get it dry so it can ignite. In order to get the fire started, I'm going to need dry kindling
[15:04] and lots of it. And the problem is, where do you find it? All the branches and moss and grass here are just soaking
[15:10] wet. I got these two dry pieces of wood I found in the shelter. So, I need to chop them down and make them into
[15:16] kindling and keep that kindling bone dry.
[15:22] Each dry piece of wood I'm going to lay over here where it's nice and dry.
[15:38] Another great fire starter is charcoal, but this stuff's soaking wet. So, we're going to dry it out.
[15:54] There you go. That works real good. Also, use your stove to dry out other pieces of wood.
[16:06] I'm out of water. Luckily, around here there is no short supply of water.
[16:16] If the water you're filtering out has a lot of sediment, it'll gum up your filter really quick. So, I use the
[16:21] carrying case for my water filter to kind of do an initial screening.
[16:27] The carrying case will filter out all the sand and sticks and other things.
[16:36] I just hang up the dirty water and gravity pulls it through a filter down the hose and fills up my water bottle.
[16:43] All right, let's go and pinch it off.
[16:53] Rumor has it there's brook trout in this lake and uh I haven't caught a brook trout in a long time. I got my rod
[17:01] rigged up with a little fly. It's got a black leech with a gold bead on it. I don't know a ton about this lake, but
[17:06] most lakes like this in Alaska have leeches in it, and trout love to eat leeches.
[17:11] I think I want to bring a hot water bottle with me fishing, but I don't want to sit and wait for a pot to boil on my
[17:17] stove.
[17:23] Woo! Yeah, that's toasty. Oh, that feels nice.
[17:47] Well, the fishing isn't going great. The rain's picking up and I am soaked to the bone. I think I might head back.
[18:02] I am soaking wet and very cold. My hot water bottle is lost its oomph. I think
[18:10] I need to do something to warm myself up. And I got an idea.
[18:17] All right, let's get warm. I'm starting to regret my idea.
[18:29] Okay, half of me is being boiled alive. Half of me is freezing to death. And there's just a little bit of sweet spot.
[18:45] Okay. Oh, I think I've got the temperature dialed in pretty good. That hot water pipe is just a touch too hot.
[18:53] So, I got a little bit of that warm waterfall coming in mixing with it. Just
[18:58] just perfect. Between the hiking and the canoeing, I'm a little bit sore. This is
[19:04] nice. Oh,
[19:13] well, I missed lunch and I'm a bit hungry, so uh I think I'm going to have a hot spring snack.
[19:32] So good.
[19:40] Oh, this is nice. But I'm starting to get overheated.
[19:48] Oh, it's a little lightheaded getting out of that hot water.
[19:56] I don't have any towels, so I'm just going to have to put on my clothes wet and dry out slowly.
[20:03] Honestly, I don't feel any wetter than I did before I got into the hot springs. But man, I'm a whole lot warmer. I'm
[20:10] starting to get hungry, so I am going to make a tin foil dinner.
[20:20] Little salt, pepper, a little pork gel, bacon on there, green onion, and a whole bunch of
[20:27] cilantro. If you're doing this at home, use Italian sausage or kilbasa instead of
[20:34] broughtwurst, and it's even better. But hey, you know, use what you got.
[20:41] All righty. Oh, I think the rain eased up. I'm going to make a fire. I better do it now.
[20:53] There we go.
[20:59] Even with a dry kindly, that fire isn't taking aggressively. There's so much humidity in the air.
[21:09] I put these wet pieces of wood up here so they can dry, but they'll also act as a roof if it starts to rain, which will
[21:14] protect the fire.
[21:49] Oh, I can hear it sizzling in there. It's so nice. Working the fire is drying my pants out. Look at that.
[22:03] There we go. I forgot to bring a fork, so I made some chopsticks. That is smelling like it's ready.
[22:10] There.
[22:17] M. That smells good. [Music] Oh, that sweet potato is so good.
[22:28] Oh, that was good. The meat and the sweet potato, a little bit of salt. Man, that's good stuff. I
[22:36] uh I think it's time to roast a marshmallow.
[22:43] Oh, that's good.
[22:50] Got some uh lemon pound cake here. Cup of hot chocolate with some cake for dessert. Not too shabby at all.
[22:59] I gotta tell you what, I'm feeling very fortunate right now. Got a nice warm fire. The rain has been really light. I
[23:05] got a full belly. I think there's a really good chance I'm going to go to bed dry and warm. Really, the only thing
[23:11] I can complain about right now is that I've got two visitors.
[23:17] Go. Get out of my tent. No. Get Get out of there. Get out of there. Okay. Come on. Come on.
[23:26] Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Come on. This way. This way, buddy. Come on. Come on.
[23:34] There we go. There's mice all over. Oh, mice can cause a lot of damage. Anything
[23:39] fuzzy, they want to steal it and take it to their nest. So, they'll chew holes in your sleeping bag. They'll pull your
[23:45] hair out. They'll chew up your jackets. And of course, they can get into your food and ruin your food.
[23:54] Dude, that's a different one.
[24:00] He's a little fatter than the other one. I'm just going to try to clean up really well and get all my stuff off the ground so they don't chew it up.
[24:08] Sure, a mouse can still get to it if they want to, but at least I'm not making it easy.
[24:14] Hopefully that'll keep my stuff away from the mice. Oh, these socks are so wet.
[24:24] And it feels so good to be warm and dry, but it's late. I've got to turn off the
[24:29] camera and I'll see you in the morning.
[24:34] Oh, good morning. I had this nightmare that I was rabbit hunting and I shot a rabbit and when I got close and picked
[24:41] it up, it was someone's palm ring. Tell this old lady that I shot her dog and thought it was a rabbit.
[24:51] Oh, everything is so damp. You hang up your clothes and they do not dry at all.
[24:56] I've got an entire change of dry clean clothes, but I'm saving it for the airplane ride home. Don't want to get
[25:02] the airplane all gross.
[25:11] Oh, it's raining good outside. It's going to be wet today.
[25:25] Oh, this blade is disgustingly dirty.
[25:44] Well, they're not exactly dry, but they're are worlds better than yesterday.
[25:51] I'll tell you what, this has been a pretty cool little adventure, but I am ready to get out of the rain. I think
[25:56] it's time to head back to the beach. I got a plane to catch. Oh, I'm going to get soaked.
[26:39] Oh, there's a seal right there.
[26:48] Well, I got a bit of bad news. I just got a message from the pilot that they're weathered in at catch can and
[26:55] they can't come get me. I don't know how bad the weather is. I don't know how long it's going to last. All I know is
[27:00] the pilot said he'd give me an update in 2 hours. That's how it is here in Alaska. You have to bow to the weather.
[27:05] The weather doesn't bow to you.
[27:12] I need to get out of this rain. I'm getting soaked.
[27:30] Oh, it's good to get out of the rain. I'm wet from the waist down and a little bit cold, but at least I'm not in the
[27:36] rain anymore. I get cold just sitting here. But if I
[27:44] go out and walk around, I get more wet. So, I've got to do little exercises under the tarp to try to stay warm.
[27:52] I don't have any more cooking fuel and I don't have a ton of food left. So, just having a really simple lunch.
[28:00] Well, the rain eased up and I got a message from the pilot. They're still socked in in catchin. So, I'm not
[28:07] getting rescued anytime soon. Maybe in a couple hours or something will change or maybe I'll be stuck here for a day or
[28:13] two. I'm using the break in the weather to walk around. I'm freezing. I'm just
[28:19] going to walk up and down this beach till I'm warm.
[28:24] Barely got half a dozen laps done and it's starting to rain a little bit.
[28:36] [Music]
[28:50] Well, it's been 5 hours and I just got a message from the pilot that they're going to try to leave. We'll see if they
[28:56] can make it. I can hear a plane. There's the plane.
[29:08] [Music]
[29:25] Thank you so much. I've got to catch my flight to Anchorage. So, they just dropped me off
[29:31] on a dock right here outside the airport.
[29:36] Oh, heat.
[29:47] Got some dry clothes on.
[30:04] Give me a hug. I missed you and Jacob. I kind of wanted
