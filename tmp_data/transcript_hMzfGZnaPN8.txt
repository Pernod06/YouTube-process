[00:00] Every single opthalmologist knows about cataract. Yes. Most common form of of blindness.
[00:06] So it would be rare for you to go to an opthalmologist with cataract and not get diagnosed. Correct.
[00:11] Correct. So why is it that the leading cause of infertility on this planet? 90% of women
[00:17] are not diagnosed. Women's health is very different than other fields of medicine. It's very it's a different
[00:23] monster. It's that cataract patient that goes to 20
[00:29] opthalmologist and she keeps saying, "I can't see." And the opthalmologist says,
[00:34] "You're crazy. There's nothing wrong with you." Welcome to the Hubberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and
[00:41] science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:46] I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest
[00:53] today is Dr. Tais Aliyabati, an obstitrician, gynecologist, and surgeon and one of the most sought-after experts
[00:59] and trusted voices in women's health. Today we discuss crucial topics in women's reproductive and general health,
[01:06] including PCOS, endometriosis, breast cancer, pmenopause, and menopause. Dr.
[01:11] Dr. Aliabati explains why so many cases of PCOS and endometriosis go undiagnosed
[01:17] and how many physicians unfortunately write off things like pain, hair thinning, mood changes, and other
[01:22] symptoms as normal when in fact they reflect larger underlying issues that can impair fertility and lead to
[01:28] bodywide health complications. And she explains the key things to do to diagnose and treat PCOS and
[01:34] endometriosis. Everything from how to adjust insulin sensitivity to hormone replacement, over-the-counter, and
[01:40] prescription-based protocols. As you'll soon hear, Dr. Aliabati is incredibly passionate about women's health and has
[01:47] developed various zerocost online tools that women of any age can use to assess their risk for things like breast
[01:53] cancer, PCOS, and endometriosis. I should also emphasize that today's discussion is relevant to women of all
[02:00] ages. Many of the conditions we discuss are starting to show up in women even in their mid- teens and 20s and can carry
[02:06] serious health risks. Dr. Aliabati makes very clear that often these issues can be resolved, but that it requires
[02:12] knowing the telltale signs and taking the appropriate steps. She explains that alas, many doctors and even OBGYNS are
[02:19] unaware of those telltale markers. So, what you're about to hear is an extremely eye-opening conversation that
[02:25] thanks to Dr. Dr. Aliabati's passion for and expertise in women's health could very well save someone's mental and
[02:31] physical health, their fertility, and in the case of breast cancer screening, even their life. Before we begin, I'd
[02:37] like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however part of
[02:42] my desire and effort to bring zerocost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general
[02:48] public. In keeping with that theme, today's episode does include sponsors. And now for my discussion with Dr. Tais
[02:54] Aliabati. Dr. Tais Aliabati. Welcome. Thank you for having me.
[03:00] Super excited to talk about today's topics and there are a lot of them because I think these days we hear a
[03:05] tremendous amount about how fertility rates are dropping. We hear that sperm counts are dropping. We hear that things
[03:11] like PCOS, which he'll explain to us, are on the rise. I'm curious if they're on the rise or they're just being
[03:17] detected or not detected as much. Let's start off quite simply and just bracket
[03:23] for people what the sort of standard trajectory of fertility looks like for
[03:30] the quote unquote average woman. I realize there's no such thing as an average woman, but I think we hear so
[03:36] much these days about people are waiting to have kids, some people are freezing eggs early, all this. If we were to just
[03:42] march through and say, you know, um what fraction of healthy women are fertile in
[03:50] their say 20 to 25, 25 to 30 and march that forward just to give people a sense
[03:56] of what the data and your experience really tell us. First of all, before I go there, I want
[04:02] to tell you something. I want to tell you how excited I am to be here today. And I'll tell you why. Because I've been
[04:07] in women's health for 30 years. And one thing I learned is that women's symptoms
[04:13] get dismissed, minimized, or completely ignored, right? It's normalized. These
[04:19] women, every time they complain, they say, "It's in your head. You're anxious. You're stressed. Um, you know, it's it's
[04:25] normal. It's part of being a woman." And behind these dismissals are millions and
[04:33] millions of women suffering undiagnosed PCOS, endometriosis,
[04:39] chronic pelvic pain, infertility, which we're going to cover right now, and so
[04:44] many other issues because no one takes the time to listen to them. And um the
[04:51] reason I'm so excited to be on this podcast is I want to shed light on these
[04:57] topics, especially endometriosis and PCOS, because they're the top leading
[05:02] causes of infertility on this planet. Majority of these patients are never
[05:08] diagnosed. Majority. And that's why I'm so excited to be here and I love talking about fertility
[05:14] because the reason these women end up in a fertility clinic in the first place Majority of them have undiagnosed PCOS
[05:22] and endometriosis. So we are born with certain number of eggs, millions of them. And we don't
[05:29] make more eggs after we're born. And as we go through life, we start losing these eggs until at about menopause, we
[05:36] have about a thousand of them left. So as we get older, the number goes down,
[05:41] but the quality also declines. The issue is PCOS and endometriosis
[05:48] affect your egg count and your egg quality. So because 90% of these
[05:54] patients are never diagnosed. What happens is they start losing their eggs. Let's say take an endometriosis patients
[05:59] which we're going to get into it. But they start losing these eggs. The quality starts shooting down. Some of
[06:05] them by age 30 they have zero eggs left. And these are patients who bounce from
[06:10] doctor to doctor and their symptoms are dismissed. They're being told that their painful period is normal, that their
[06:17] painful sex is in their head, that they're exaggerating their pain, and meanwhile their ovarian reserve is
[06:24] completely depleting, and no one is addressing that. Andrew, I've always
[06:29] said this, and I really mean it. If every 20-year-old in this country would
[06:34] go through my office once at age 20, I would shut down these fertility clinics.
[06:41] Because where do these patients end up? In fertility clinics. That's why these
[06:46] doctors are so busy. And that's why these patients go bankrupt, selling their homes, selling everything they
[06:52] have to pay for an IVF cycle that could have been completely blocked had they
[06:58] been diagnosed correctly and treated at a very young age. And I'm talking
[07:04] sometimes I treat 13y olds with endometriosis. I have right now in my
[07:09] practice a girl at 14 with endometriosis whose egg count is the egg count of a
[07:16] 40year-old. That's why you can't I can't sit here and generalize that if you're in your
[07:21] 20s you're going to be fine. It's not true. You need to know at a very young
[07:28] age, every girl on this planet needs to be screened
[07:33] for endometriosis, for PCOS, and they need to know their
[07:38] egg count. Egg count, AMH, antimmalarian hormone, is a simple blood test. It's
[07:44] covered by most insuranceances. It needs to be offered if you don't want to offer it to your young patients because, you
[07:50] know, teenagers are tricky because they have so many eggs. But if they're complaining of severe pain, if they're
[07:56] missing school, if you're have if you as a parent, you have to go pick them up from school, the nurse is calling you,
[08:03] they don't want to take their test because they're rolled up in bed from pain. That patient, even at 14, deserves
[08:08] an egg count check because for these patients, sometimes by age 16, I freeze
[08:15] their eggs. Incredible. So I'm going to reframe my question on the basis of what you just
[08:20] said um and ask is the typical plot that we see of you know this x number of uh
[08:28] or x percentage of of women of a given age bracket are of this fertile or not
[08:34] fertile meaning how many trials or times it would take in order to successfully um get pregnant carry a baby to turn.
[08:42] Should we either discard or think differently about the data that we see plotted out? Like if I were to go into
[08:48] one of the AI platforms and ask, I'm sure it would generate a plot for me. What I'm hearing from you is that
[08:53] because PCOS and endometriosis are not taken into account. The textbook picture
[08:59] is a false picture of fertility as a function of age. Correct. And that's why I have a patient
[09:05] who came to me, she was 24, severe pain. She said, I listened to your podcast. I
[09:10] went to my doctor and I asked her, my gynecologist, and I said, "I have really bad painful periods and I think I have
[09:17] endometriosis. Can you check my egg count?" You know what the doctor told her? Her gynecologist, "You're too
[09:24] young. It would be malpractice for me to check your egg count because at 24, you
[09:30] should not have any issues and you have no problems getting pregnant." I operate
[09:35] on stage 4 endometriosis patients at age 18. That's why I'm here. That's why I want
[09:41] to grab this mic. And that's why I want to just focus first on PCOS and then
[09:47] focus on endometriosis. Cuz these two conditions, you don't need a doctor to diagnose you. If you listen
[09:54] to this podcast, by the time you and I are done, whoever is listening, if it's a parent, if it's your sister, if it's
[10:01] yourself, if it's your daughter, you're going to be able to diagnose these conditions, the leading causes of
[10:07] infertility on this planet. It can be diagnosed by the time we're done. You're going to walk on the street and you're
[10:13] going to say, "I think that woman has PCOS." I'm serious. That my patients are so smart. They
[10:20] literally send their friends. They're like, "I'm sending you my cousin because she has endometriosis." Patients are
[10:26] diagnosing when doctors are not. Incredible. That's why I'm looking forward to these robotic doctors. I read that China has
[10:33] this robotic hospital. I'm like, "Praise the Lord. These robots are not going to dismiss women. If you tell a robot, sex
[10:41] hurts, I stay in bed, I end up in the emergency room every time I have my period," the
[10:47] robot will not call you crazy. The robot will say, "You probably have endometriosis."
[10:52] But let's work it up. Glucose is a key player in how our body functions, not just in the long term,
[10:59] but in every moment of our lives. That's because it is the major fuel for our cells, especially our brain cells.
[11:05] Glucose directly impacts our brain function, mood, and energy levels, and it may even affect our levels of
[11:10] tenacity and willpower. This is why I use the continuous glucose monitor from Lingo. I absolutely love it and I'm
[11:17] thrilled to have them as a sponsor of the podcast. Lingo helps me track my glucose in real time to see how the
[11:22] foods I eat and the actions I take impact my glucose. When glucose in your body spikes or crashes, your cognitive
[11:28] and physical performance do too. In fact, large glucose peaks and valleys lead to brain fog, fatigue,
[11:34] irritability, and hunger. What you eat, of course, plays a major role in your glucose. Some foods cause sharp spikes
[11:39] and big crashes, and others do not. But not everyone is the same in terms of how they respond to particular foods. Seeing
[11:46] your glucose in real time helps you build eating and other habits that support metabolic health, mental
[11:51] clarity, and sustained energy. Lingo has helped me to better understand what foods to eat, when to eat, and how
[11:57] things like a brief walk after a meal can help keep my glucose stable, and much more. If you'd like to try Lingo,
[12:03] Lingo is offering Huberman podcast listeners in the US 10% off a four-week Lingo plan. Terms and conditions apply.

[12:15] also brought to us by ourplace. Ourplace makes my favorite pots, pans, and other cookware. Surprisingly, toxic compounds
[12:22] such as PASES or forever chemicals are still found in 80% of non-stick pans, as
[12:28] well as utensils, appliances, and countless other kitchen products. As I've discussed before on this podcast,
[12:34] these PASES or forever chemicals like Teflon have been linked to major health issues such as hormone disruption, gut
[12:40] microbiome disruption, fertility issues, and many other health problems. So, it's very important to avoid them. This is
[12:46] why I'm a huge fan of ourplace. Our products are made with the highest quality materials and are all PAS and
[12:53] toxin-free. I particularly love their Titanium Always Pan Pro. It's the first non-stick pan made with zero chemicals
[12:59] and zero coating. Instead, it uses pure titanium. This means it has no harmful
[13:04] forever chemicals and does not degrade or lose its non-stick effect over time. It's also beautiful to look at. I cook
[13:11] eggs in my titanium Always Pan Pro almost every morning. The design allows for the eggs to cook perfectly without
[13:17] sticking to the pan. I also cook burgers and steaks in it, and it always puts a really nice sear on the meat. But again,
[13:23] nothing sticks to it, so it's really easy to clean, and it's even dishwasher safe. I love it, and I use it
[13:28] constantly. Our Place now has a full line of titanium Pro cookwware that uses the firstofits-kind titanium non-stick
[13:34] technology. So, if you're looking for non-toxic, long-lasting pots and pans, go to fromourplace.com/huberman
[13:41] and use the code hubman. Right now, HourPlace is having their biggest sale of the year. You can get up to 35% off
[13:47] all products now through January 12th, 2026. With a 100-day risk-free trial,
[13:53] free shipping, and free returns, you can try HourPlace with zero risk, and you can see why more than 1 million people

[14:05] to get up to 35% off. Well, clearly you're on an important mission and clearly it's good that we
[14:12] reframe the question that I initially asked and start with PCOS and then endometriosis. But before I do that, I
[14:18] just want to um just give a reflection which is u one of the takeaways from what you just said and just one there
[14:26] are many but one of them is that most young women learn about the
[14:31] menstrual cycle. I think they also make an attempt to teach boys about the menstrual cycle when we were in high
[14:37] school. They they try to teach everybody. Whether or not it sinks in to to the males brains is is a question of
[14:43] debate, but most every woman learns at some point about the menstrual cycle. It sounds to me like female health
[14:50] education should also include education about PCOS and endometriosis at a very
[14:56] young age. Mandatory. It should be mandatory. And currently I it's not. In fact, many
[15:02] um female listeners of this podcast, I believe, um either suffer from or know
[15:08] somebody who suffers from PCOS or endometriosis. I know this cuz I get asked a lot uh to cover these topics,
[15:13] which is one of the reasons you're here. And the other thing is that I'm I'm certain that many do not that many do
[15:19] not because they came up through an education system where that just didn't happen. So, we can start this important
[15:26] initiative now. Um what is PCOS? Very good question. So PCOS is the most
[15:33] common hormone disorder in women in the reproductive age. The most common. So
[15:39] we're not talking about some rare diagnosis. Number one, it affects 15% of
[15:45] women in this country. If you go to Middle Eastern countries, that number can go north of 20%.
[15:53] Studies show that 70% of these patients are never diagnosed. I tell you today
[16:00] that that number is over 90%. Majority of these patients are never diagnosed or even when they're
[16:07] diagnosed, they're not being treated correctly. I listen to podcasts on PCOS
[16:13] where doctors come and uh you know, whoever's interviewing them ask them, "So, what do we do for PCOS?" And the
[16:18] answer is we give birth control. That's not true. Birth control is just one tiny
[16:24] little aspect of the entire treatment plan and that's why patients get
[16:30] frustrated. So when it comes to diagnosing PCOS, right, you need to meet
[16:35] two out of three criteria. The first one being symptoms of high testosterone or
[16:41] high androgens. What are those? Facial hair, body hair, the most common acne,
[16:46] oily skin or male pattern hair thinning which a lot of women complain of. Number
[16:52] two is basically uh ovulation dysfunction. These are women with
[16:58] irregular periods. They get their periods um over like you know 35 days.
[17:04] It's not regular 28 days or they get about eight periods per year. These are
[17:10] patients who usually come to the doctor and when you ask them how your periods are, they can't really tell. They tell
[17:15] you it's irregular. I can't quite pinpoint when I'm going to get my period. And number three is PCOS looking
[17:22] ovaries on ultrasound. Polycystic ovary syndrome does not mean cyst. That's a
[17:28] bad name. It's a very specific finding on ultrasound. When you see almost like 20
[17:36] plus follicles in the ovary and these are follicles. They look like string of pearl. It's very specific to PCOS. The
[17:44] issue is doctors don't recognize it. they dismiss it and they look at the ovary and they like they say, "Oh, you
[17:50] have so many eggs you have no issues with fertility." So PCOS looking ovaries
[17:56] on ultrasound does not mean cyst. To this day, doctors tell patients, "I don't see a cyst on your ovary, so you
[18:01] don't have PCOS." So PCOS is an ultrasound finding.
[18:07] However, in 2023, they added another criteria to this third um criteria,
[18:15] which is elevated egg count or elevated AMH. So, women who have very high AMH,
[18:23] that is a telltale sign for PCOS. And that's what we were talking about before
[18:29] this podcast. Yeah. Because so many women who are interested in and concerned about their fertility will go in and get their AMH
[18:35] measured. And so many just have in mind to that you just want the higher numbers. Higher is better, right?
[18:41] The higher is better. But in case of PCOS, higher does not mean good quality
[18:47] eggs. I see. We're going to talk about that. So you need to meet two of these three criteria. Only two of the three. You don't need
[18:53] all three. No. So if you have irregular periods, right, and you have uh PCOS looking
[19:00] ovaries on ultrasound, you meet the criteria. If you have uh irregular periods and you have symptoms of high
[19:06] testosterone, you qualify. Now, let me tell you, you do not need to have a high
[19:11] testosterone in the blood to get the diagnosis of PCOS. If you do, great.
[19:17] Then you qualify for that high testosterone symptom or in blood. But you do not need to have a high
[19:23] testosterone in your blood. And that's why a lot of doctors tell their patients, well, I checked your hormones
[19:28] and your testosterone is normal. That's not one of the diagnostic criteria. So if you're sitting at home, if you
[19:34] have irregular period, if you have a daughter who gets laser of, you know, constantly is lasering her face, she has
[19:41] acne, she's on spirolactone, she takes Accutane, these are criteria. She meets the criteria of PCOS. PCOS patients have
[19:48] mood disorder. If you listen to them, they struggle from with anxiety, depression. They're moody people. Uh 75%
[19:57] of them gain weight. 25% of them are very lean. I see a lot of eating
[20:02] disorder or disordered eating in my PCOS patients. I would literally tell you
[20:08] that 60 70% of my PCOS patients have disordered eating. You want to find PCOS
[20:14] patients, go knock on the doors of these eating disorder centers. They're sitting behind those doors, undiagnosed, and
[20:21] it's the leading cause of infertility. So this is the big picture of PCOS. So
[20:29] imagine these women who are walking around, they're gaining weight, they can't lose it, they're anxious, they
[20:34] can't get pregnant, they have acne, hair loss, facial hair, body hair, their periods are irregular. They go to the
[20:42] doctor and what do they hear? There's nothing wrong with you. Eat less. You
[20:47] probably need to exercise more. That's all they hear. What do they do? They put them in eating
[20:52] disorder centers when they're a teenager and they feed them pizza and they say, "If you don't eat this pizza, that means
[20:59] your eating disorder is not better." I did a podcast with a patient of mine, Phoebe. She said in this eating disorder
[21:05] center, every day they would put pizza in front of her. And she would say, "I I I eat this pizza, but when I eat it, I
[21:12] get sick. I can't I feel awful when I have this pizza." You know what they
[21:17] would tell her? See, you have an eating disorder. you're not ready to go. No, she had PCOS. But at least if you
[21:24] diagnose and validate them, you can start helping them better.
[21:29] I have several questions. Um you mentioned irregular periods and um I think to most people that means that
[21:37] whatever cycle length they are accustomed to 28 days or 30 days or even
[21:43] you know 22 days that it's regular um and that if it changes by you know plus
[21:48] or minus 5 days or so for you know more than 2 or 3 months out of the year then
[21:53] you would call that irregular. Okay. But if a given how young you're seeing PCOS
[22:00] in your clinic and given that women start menrating at let's say in the in their in their mid- teens early teens I
[22:07] mean I know the age is getting pushed back and but it's going to vary but I could imagine I I've only lived as a
[22:13] male so I'm I'm really uh truly imagining here but I could only imagine that for a lot of women cycle regularity
[22:19] is something that they're still figuring out at the stage when they could already have PCO. OS, maybe not full-blown PCOS,
[22:26] but more milder forms of PCOS. And so this notion of regular periods versus irregular periods, it could be quite
[22:33] confusing for someone to figure out. Um, if it's happening on a backdrop of PCOS,
[22:39] uh, and then that of course leaves aside all the, you know, stress and food induced regulation of of menstrual cycle
[22:45] length etc. So it seems like a very difficult thing to identify. So that's actually you brought up a very good
[22:51] point and I want to make that very clear for teenagers you have to be very careful very cautious diagnosing them
[22:59] with PCOS. Why? As you said when you first start having your periods your periods are irregular and if you do an
[23:06] ultrasound these young ovaries have tons of follicles. So actually the PCOS um uh
[23:14] PCOS morphology does is not used for teenagers. For teenagers to get the
[23:20] diagnosis of PCOS they need to have criteria one which is the irregular
[23:25] period and criteria two which is the high androgen symptoms. You do not use
[23:31] the AMH or PCOS morphology on ultrasound as a diagnostic criteria. Number one.
[23:37] Number two, you want to be very careful diagnosing these patients because you don't want to label them at a very young
[23:43] age. So what I do with these patients, I do a hormone panel and these are patients who usually at a very young age
[23:50] they end up on Accutane for their acne. You give them spirolactone and it's not working. They complain of hair loss.
[23:57] They're gaining weight. They're showing signs of an eating disorder. They're anxious. They're not feeling well. they
[24:03] have really bad I see a lot of PMDD with my PCOS patients. So you look at the big
[24:09] picture and I tend to not label them but I will treat them. And uh you know in uh
[24:17] um 2014 I started using GLP1s on my patients for weight loss for PCOS. 2014
[24:25] 11 years ago. I think most people don't realize that these peptides were out there. They weren't as commonly discussed. they were
[24:31] sort of considered a little bit niche, a little bit, you know, was certainly cutting edge. Incredible. Okay. A
[24:37] question that I just um have to ask is because PCOS is diagnosed, if it's
[24:44] diagnosed properly, by this kind of amalgam of different features and and you mentioned by ultrasound, this kind
[24:50] of characteristic lining up of of the follicles. I have to ask what might
[24:56] sound like a politically incorrect question, but I'm going to ask it anyway. Do you think that male OBGYNS
[25:03] more often make this mistake than female OBGYNS or is this an equally distributed problem in the OBGYn community?
[25:10] Equal. 90% of these patients, let me tell you, are never diagnosed. A a lot of
[25:17] gynecologists don't do a pelvic ultrasound, which I want to change that in this country. It needs to be part of a wellwoman exam.
[25:23] They don't do a pelvic ultrasound. No. Is there I I'm I'm baffled. what what is
[25:29] the reason for not doing it? They're not trained to do it or they have to hire a ultrasound tech to their
[25:34] office to do it. Uh or they but for me in my office, if you come to my office
[25:40] and you say you can't do an ultrasound, it's just like me grabbing your glasses right now and say read how can I how can
[25:47] I diagnose you? Pelvic ultrasound should be mandatory. That's another topic I
[25:52] want to cover with the what wellwoman exam should look like versus what women get when they go to their doctor's
[25:58] office. So one of the issues is because women don't get a pelvic ultrasound. No one knows. One, two, a lot of doctors
[26:06] don't even know what a PCOS looking ovary looks like. They think polycystic ovary syndrome means cysts on the ovary.
[26:13] The naming is really a problem. And this is true in science and very clearly true in medicine as well. the what things are
[26:20] named can be it can be very useful but it can also really limit understanding. Yeah. Uh if anything um today's
[26:28] discussion hopefully will maybe even remove or put an asterisk next to the C and in and PCOS. you know, they want to
[26:35] change the name, but I personally am against it because I've spent
[26:42] 25 years saying PCOS, PCOS, PCOS, PCOS. And I feel like just in the past few
[26:48] years, more and more people, you know, like people didn't talk about menopause. Now, everyone's talking about uh
[26:55] menopause. I feel like PCOS is the next topic hopefully. And if you go and change the name,
[27:02] then I feel like I have to start all over again. No, but you make a very good point. We don't want that to have to happen. And I
[27:07] agree. But they're trying to do it. There's this there's a a strange thing in public health where there needs to be
[27:13] a ton of hydraulic pressure over time. Like, you know, I guess today's my day to be only slightly politically
[27:19] incorrect. You know, 5 years ago, if you said the word obese or you said, you know, this person has health issues
[27:24] because they're obese. It was considered I mean, people were losing jobs for for making statements like that. Now, we
[27:29] understand obesity to be a serious risk to brain and body health. It's a medical condition. I think the GLPs have kind of
[27:35] helped shift the view now because there's a medical treatment, but it was always true that obesity was dangerous for people,
[27:41] but now you can say it. So, I do think that there need to be a lot of hydraulic pressure behind that. And now, um,
[27:46] you're doing the same for PCOS. So, uh, I have a couple questions about the thinning of of hair, acne, and so forth.
[27:54] I could imagine that a number of women listening to this are thinking, well, you know, I've got a little bit of acne.
[27:59] My hair is thinner than it was 5 years ago, but, you know, is this mild PCOS?
[28:05] Is this indicative of PCOS? I mean, everyone knows that hopefully knows their body best, but how bad does the
[28:12] acne or the hair thinning have to be? How rapid before you might say, you know, it it's maybe just, you know, the
[28:18] the hairs seemingly thinner. Um there's a little bit more acne. It's back acne, but and is it throughout the cycle?
[28:24] Yes, it's throughout the cycle. And these are patients who usually come to the office asking for help. They say, "I
[28:30] can't get rid of my acne." I always say, if you're twer than 25 and you're struggling with acne and you come to my
[28:36] office and you're asking for sperolactone and Accutane, something's not right. Right. If you
[28:42] have hair thinning, like you brush your hair and you lose tons of hair. I mean, these are patients you look at, you
[28:47] could look at their scalp and you know they're losing hair. I'm not talking about the hair loss that you get postpartum. Do you know what that's
[28:54] transitional and it recovers in like 9 to 12 months. These are symptoms that persist and as they get these patients
[29:00] get older, it becomes more and more and more significant. But the reason I give
[29:06] that big picture is I always look at other factors. Are they having a hard
[29:11] time losing weight? Do they have mood disorder? Do they have any history of eating disorder? Have they been on
[29:17] Accutane? Do they go and laser their hair like twice a year because they
[29:23] can't get rid of it. It's a pattern that you will know. It's not a little bit of this and a these are patients. Patients
[29:29] who are listening right now to me, they're going to say, "Yes, I have this. I have every symptom." And I put a check
[29:36] in front of it. The problem with PCOS is there are four different phenotypes of
[29:41] PCOS. That's why it's so confusing for doctors to diagnose PCOS. The most
[29:47] common classic phenotype is a patient that has all three PCOS looking ovaries
[29:52] on ultrasound. Elevated testosterone symptoms or high testosterone or androgens in the blood or and irregular
[29:59] period and irregular period. The second type B patients have the high
[30:08] androgen symptoms. They do have um dysfunctional ovulation with irregular
[30:14] periods. But these patients have normal ovaries on ultrasound. So you can't in
[30:20] this group of patients you can't do an ultrasound and say your ovaries are not PCOS looking so you don't have it. Then
[30:25] the third phenotype is the ovulatory PCOS. It gets very confusing. this group
[30:32] of uh PCOS patients actually ovulate at least sometimes because you know 70 to
[30:39] 80% of PCOS patients don't ovulate 70 to 80% do not ovulate even when they
[30:47] have regular cycles. So of the 20 30% who ovulate you need to ovulate to get
[30:53] pregnant this se phenotype these patients are
[30:59] ovulating sometimes with regular cycles. So these are PCOS
[31:06] patients who go to the doctor, they have PCOS looking ovaries on ultrasound, they have acne, hair loss, facial hair, body
[31:12] hair, mood, all of that, but their periods are regular. Even these patients
[31:19] a lot of times are not ovulating. That regular cycle that you're seeing is estrogen withdrawal. It's not from the
[31:26] progesterone of ovulation. And we're going to get into all that if you want to. And the fourth category, these are
[31:33] patients who um basically don't have any uh elevated testosterone or androgen
[31:39] symptoms. They don't have acne, hair loss, facial hair, body hair. They just don't ovulate regularly and they have
[31:45] PCOS looking ovaries on ultrasound. So imagine these four phenotypes, right?
[31:51] And imagine all the insulin resistance and all these other underlying conditions. It makes the big picture,
[31:59] the image of these patients so different. They all present differently to the office. That's why doctors
[32:04] scratch their heads. That's why doctors don't want to diagnose PCOS because they really don't understand all these
[32:09] phenotypes. They don't understand that you can be completely thin and have PCOS. That not all PCOS patients need to
[32:16] have weight issues. That you don't have to have acne, hair loss, facial hair, body hair. That in some phenotypes you
[32:23] don't need to have a PCOS looking ovaries. there's some that have regular cycles. So that's why it gets so
[32:29] confusing. It is uh confusing and yet I think when
[32:34] one hears that there there are different um indicators obviously and it sounds like a a skilled practitioner like
[32:40] yourself can can see the contour of which ones fit together. I it's pattern pattern recognition clinical pattern
[32:46] recognition which is very difficult to do from an AI search or from it's impossible really. I mean I think um I
[32:53] have a couple of questions. Uh one is just leap to mind as it relates to the
[32:59] mood disorders. Um I could imagine that some of these disorders are treated or
[33:05] they attempt to treat them through uh anti-depressants, SSRIs and things of that sort. Is there any indication that
[33:11] the drug treatments for these mood disorders interact with the hormones that we're talking about in a way that
[33:18] exacerbates the PCOS? I mean we know that serotonin and dopamine all these things have feedback and interaction
[33:23] with these hormones or do you think that um that's se a separate thing entirely? In order to answer that I think it's
[33:30] better for me to tell you the underlying drivers of the symptoms of PCOS and how
[33:37] those can affect the mood. And by treating the underlying conditions,
[33:42] sometimes you can address mood changes without having to give them a zoloft or
[33:49] alexapore. You might have to, right? But there's no evidence from what I understand that those drugs are actually
[33:54] causing PCOS. Okay. I just want to essentially rule that out. Right. Okay. Good. I'm relieved to hear that because
[34:00] those drugs are not to my knowledge. I've never experienced that. My my, you know, not so cursory uh web
[34:07] search on this uh said no, but I I want to verify with you. So, um so what is
[34:13] the cause of the mood disorders? You're talking slightly elevated testosterone. So, all the all the males listening are
[34:18] like, "Oo, sounds great." And of course, um supplementing with testosterone um in
[34:23] women in menopause has now become kind of a trendy thing. And you can absolutely do that with PCOS patients. We can get to that. But I is
[34:31] it okay if I discuss the underlying pillars because it's very important and I think that's what people don't
[34:37] understand and I think that's what I've observed in my practice at least over
[34:42] the past 25 years and it's so important to understand it because if you don't understand it then you don't know how to
[34:48] treat PCOS then you don't just throw birth control pill at it and that's why these patients don't feel better so
[34:55] they're underlying pillars that drive the symptoms of PCOS us the number one
[35:01] issue is the brain pituitary ovary access which I'm sure you know it by
[35:08] heart but as you know our hypothalamus releases a hormone called G&R that
[35:14] stimulates in a uh it fires in a pulsatile fashion and basically it
[35:20] stimulates the pituitary gland to release this hormone called FSH which stimulates the follicles in the ovaries
[35:28] as the follicles one follicle per month. As the follicle gets stimulated and starts growing, it starts releasing
[35:34] estrogen. When the estrogen peaks really high for 48 hours, it stimulates that
[35:41] same pituitary gland to release a hormone called LH. And LH is responsible
[35:47] for ovulation. It comes, it basically weakens the wall of the follicle. It
[35:53] causes inflammation. It causes vascular changes, all of that. So the egg gets released. Once the egg gets released,
[35:59] whatever's left of that follicle is the corpus ludial cyst which starts releasing progesterone to basically uh
[36:07] support implantation. This is what's supposed to happen and that's how people get pregnant.
[36:12] It's such a beautiful mechanism, right? Very cells that are stimulated by FSH produce a hormone which feeds back to
[36:19] shut down the production of FSH and bring in the LH. I mean it's it's a I mean it's a beautiful molecular set of
[36:25] gears basically. It's beautiful. I mean not to make it too reductionist but it's it's truly incredible when one thinks
[36:31] about it. And as you mentioned that it spans from the brain all the way to the ovary. It's to the uterus. It's it's a
[36:38] it's a spectacular set of of interactions really. And you know that estrogen that the follicle is uh stimulating gets the
[36:46] lining of the uterus nice and juicy ready for pregnancy. And then when the egg ovulates and now the progesterone
[36:53] comes, the progesterone stabilizes that lining so the embryo can go and implant
[36:58] and turn into a beautiful baby. And usually that cyst, the corpus ludial cyst during the first 12 weeks of
[37:04] pregnancy is helping release the progesterone to help the pregnancy really stick to that wall of the uterus.
[37:10] In simple terms, nothing wasted. Nothing. But women are incredible, aren't we? Incredible. It's amazing. I mean, it's it it indeed
[37:17] indeed they are. It's it's like nothing's wasted. The the portion of the follicle that that would otherwise be
[37:23] quote unquote discarded is actually a source of critical hormones. It's incredible. It's incredible. It's incredible. But let me tell you what happens in a
[37:30] poor PCOS patient. That's the problem. The G&RH, remember that secretes from
[37:37] the hypothalamus, it starts pulsating super fast. By doing
[37:43] that, it shifts the FSH LH balance. So
[37:48] FSH goes down and LH goes up. LH
[37:53] stimulates these cells in the ovary. I don't know if you remember the thea cells in the ovary and they start
[37:59] pumping androgens out, right? And it when you have a lot of androgens in the
[38:06] ovaries, the androgens block the growth of that beautiful follicle that's
[38:11] growing to ovulate. So it freezes the follicle and it prevents it from ovulating.
[38:17] The follicle is still secretreting the estrogen, but it never gets to that peak high, right? And it's still stimulating
[38:25] the lining of the uterus, but the ovulation doesn't happen. So when the
[38:31] ovulation doesn't happen, polycystic ovary syndrome, you start seeing these
[38:36] follicles in the ovary. So is it um lack of sufficient LH?
[38:42] It's too much LH in PCOS. the LH FSH
[38:47] ratio flips. So the LH is twice as much as the FSH. So you have this constant
[38:53] secretion of LH that stimulates these cells to just pump androgens out, right?
[39:00] So the follicle freezes, doesn't ovulate, the follicle stays in the
[39:05] ovary. And one thing that they've noticed with PCOS patients, for whatever reason, their ovary is super sensitive
[39:12] to the LH. It's like adding fuel to the fire. It's like a positive feedback. The
[39:17] reason I asked if it's if it's um how LH is adjusted is the the LH surge is what
[39:23] triggers ovulation normally. Correct. But there is no LH surge. What I'm getting a kind of mental visual of is that um the strong pull of the
[39:31] levers is is it's just a bunch of smaller levers being pulled repeatedly. But but there's still shedding of the
[39:37] uterine lining, right? There's still menses. So it can be. So that's why it's probably very misleading for people who
[39:42] don't have extreme symptoms of PCOS because they think, well, if they're menrating, then they assume that they're
[39:48] ovulating. And 20 to 30% of them actually ovulate, right? But they don't always ovulate.
[39:55] That's the problem. And of the ones who ovulate, it gets worse. of the ones who let's say you
[40:03] know this uh brain pituitary ovary access is just partially disrupted
[40:10] of the ones who ovulate 40% of them the embryo does either
[40:17] doesn't form because the quality of the egg is bad but also the environment is not ready for it so the progesterone the
[40:26] uterine lining is not ready for it that's why these patients don't get that
[40:31] what is thought to disrupt the hypothalamic uh G&RH neurons
[40:36] it could be everything it could it comes to all the other pillars yes but but is there any evidence um I mean
[40:43] we don't want to attribute everything to psychological stress but the more I learn about the brain and body and their
[40:48] interactions over the years the more I'm convinced that psychological state does impact hormones and brain function
[40:55] anyone listening will say of course it does but 10 years ago there was this notion of psychossematic illness people
[41:01] would say oh they would say it's all in your head we now know that um that stress is a is a powerful modulator of
[41:07] hypothalamic function it actually comes from the hypothalamus in part so I is there evidence that this is you
[41:14] know preceded by stress or trauma things of that sort it just comes absolutely it yes it's genetic and
[41:20] that's why I want to talk about it this is just the first pillar you saw like just the first driving force is this
[41:28] brain main pituitary ovary pathway that's completely disrupted that some most patients 70 to 80% don't even
[41:35] ovulate and of the ones who ovulate the environment is not really good for the
[41:41] embryo so that's just the first pillar but at its core PCOS has insulin
[41:48] resistance and I'm sure you know all about insulin resistance but I want to explain it please remind our audience because you know we we have newcomers to the
[41:54] conversation and I don't think we could hear enough about insulin resistance resistance as a gynecologist, I'll
[42:00] explain insulin resistance. So, I'm sure you've had, you know, physicians uh who
[42:05] probably explain it better, but I'm going to simplify it because it's one of the biggest drivers of PCOS symptom and
[42:12] it's extremely common. Even lean PCOS patients can have insulin resistance.
[42:17] So, what is insulin resistance? The simple way of explaining it is when we eat carbohydrates and our body breaks it
[42:23] down into glucose, glucose stimulates our pancreas to release a hormone called insulin. The job of insulin is it goes
[42:31] to the cells in our muscle in our liver and it opens up the channels on these
[42:36] cells and pushes sugar into the cell where it can turn into energy. So
[42:41] basically insulin takes the sugar from the blood, pushes into the cell and turns it into energy. PCOS patients, 80%
[42:48] of them have insulin resistance. It's not their fault. They're born that way. What does insulin resistant do? When
[42:56] they eat carbohydrate and their body breaks it down into glucose, glucose stimulates their pancreas to release
[43:01] insulin, but their cells are resistant. And I'll tell you why. Remember that androgen that I was talking to you about
[43:08] that gets secreted from their ovaries because of the first pillar makes women
[43:13] more insulin resistant. So, their cells don't respond well. I know it's like,
[43:18] let me get there. It's do the the question I was going to ask was going to be a facicious one. I was going to say, do androgens do anything
[43:24] good? No, of course they do. But do women. No, they do. Well, women need androgens, but they don't need this many
[43:30] androgens coming from the theal cells. Right. Right. So, when their cells can't uptake this
[43:36] glucose, glucose bounces in the blood. Well, you can't have blood stay I mean, glucose stay in your blood. You have to
[43:41] clear it. So as glucose goes up, it pushes our insulin to go up. What does
[43:48] insulin do to PCOS patients? Number one, when insulin goes up, insulin stimulates
[43:55] our ovaries to push more androgens out. How about that? And it blocks the
[44:01] ovulation. It freezes that follicle, right? And it causes acne, hair loss, facial hair, body hair, irregular
[44:07] periods, all of that. The other thing insulin does, it blocks
[44:13] the liver from secretreting sex hormone binding globbulin. If you do a blood
[44:18] test on a PCOS patient, a lot of them the sex hormone binding globbulin is low. Sex hormone binding globulin is a
[44:24] protein in the blood that grabs free testosterone from our blood. Right? When the levels go down because of high
[44:31] insulin, our free androgens and testosterone go up. So more acne, hair
[44:36] loss, facial hair, body hair, all those symptoms. I see. High insulin does one more thing. It
[44:43] basically tells your body, take this sugar, get rid of it from the blood and store it as fat. How does it do that? It
[44:51] pushes our liver to turn it into triglyceride. The triglycerides can a go
[44:57] into our blood as a form of VLDL and go and attach themselves to the heart. And that's why PCOS patients, you have to
[45:03] screen them their lipid panel because of their cholesterol, risk of cardiovascular disease, risk of
[45:08] diabetes, all of that. But what it does, it sends these triglycerides to our
[45:15] visceral organs. So these patients start having visceral fat. Visceral fat is
[45:22] very different than the fat that you have under your skin. Visceral fat actually c releases cytoines
[45:29] inflammatory factors that increases the inflammation.
[45:34] Inflammation makes our insulin resistance worse and inflammation which
[45:41] is the next pillar stimulates our ovaries to secrete more
[45:46] androgens. So it's a vicious feedback cycle. And I think maybe if we just double click on
[45:52] uh visceral fat a little bit. We've never talked about it on this podcast really. And I'm not a visceral fat expert.
[45:57] No. Well, nor do I expect you to be, but I think it's it it's worth um people just hearing twice that visceral fat is
[46:04] not subcutaneous fat. This is why some PCOS patients can be lean. Um indeed,
[46:10] many people, male or female, can be lean and have too much visceral fat. It's important to correct. You can now detect
[46:16] visceral fat and I believe MRI will do it. Not everyone of course has access to MRI. fatty liver they call it. You know
[46:23] what I'm saying? But it gets dismissed. But it's a very dangerous form of fat
[46:29] because of that inflammation. We've known for a long time that there are things that we can do to improve our
[46:35] sleep. And that includes things that we can take things like magnesium thrienate, theine, chamomile extract,
[46:41] and glycine along with lesserk known things like saffron and valyan root. These are all clinically supported
[46:47] ingredients that can help you fall asleep, stay asleep, and wake up feeling more refreshed. I'm excited to share
[46:52] that our longtime sponsor, AG1, just created a new product called AGZ, a
[46:57] nightly drink designed to help you get better sleep and have you wake up feeling super refreshed. Over the past few years, I've worked with the team at
[47:03] AG1 to help create this new AGZ formula. It has the best sleep supporting compounds in exactly the right ratios in
[47:10] one easy to drink mix. This removes all the complexity of trying to forge the vast landscape of supplements focused on
[47:16] sleep and figuring out the right dosages and which ones to take for you. AGZ is, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive
[47:23] sleep supplement on the market. I take it 30 to 60 minutes before sleep. It's delicious, by the way, and it
[47:29] dramatically increases both the quality and the depth of my sleep. I know that both from my subjective experience of my
[47:34] sleep and because I track my sleep. I'm excited for everyone to try this new AGZ formulation and to enjoy the benefits of
[47:40] better sleep. AGZ is available in chocolate, chocolate mint, and mixed berry flavors. And as I mentioned
[47:45] before, they're all extremely delicious. My favorite of the three has to be, I think, chocolate mint, but I really like
[47:51] them all. If you'd like to try AGZ, go to drink az.com/huberman
[47:56] to get a special offer. Again, that's drinkagz.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by
[48:03] JWV. JWV makes medical grade red light therapy devices. Now, if there's one thing that I have consistently
[48:09] emphasized on this podcast, it is the incredible impact that light can have on our biology. Now, in addition to
[48:15] sunlight, red light and near infrared light sources have been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous
[48:20] aspects of cellar and organ health, including faster muscle recovery, improved skin health and wound healing,
[48:26] improvements in acne, reduced pain and inflammation, even mitochondrial function, and improving vision itself.
[48:33] What sets THW lights apart and why they're my preferred red light therapy device is that they use clinically
[48:38] proven wavelengths, meaning specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in combination to trigger
[48:44] the optimal cellar adaptations. Personally, I use the JWV whole body panel about three to four times a week,
[48:50] and I use the JWV handheld light both at home and when I travel. Right now, JW is having their biggest sale of the year.
[48:56] From now through December 1st, 2025, you can save up to $1,000 on select JWV
[49:01] devices during their Black Friday sale. Just go to jv.com/huberman. That's jovv.com/huberman.
[49:09] Some exclusions apply. So the next pillar is chronic inflammation. That's why PCOS patients
[49:16] have this chronic inflammation that they complain about. And this chronic inflammation
[49:23] basically stimulates their ovaries to release more androgens. This chronic
[49:28] inflammation makes their insulin resistance worse. This chronic inflammation can affect their gut.
[49:36] That's why PCOS patients come and say, "I don't feel good. I have food sensitivities. I feel bloated." Because
[49:42] these hormonal shifts and these inflammations do affect our gut. Then we
[49:47] go to the next pillar which is genetics. If you look in PCOS families, there's
[49:53] someone who's either diabetic, pre-diabetic, had gestational diabetes, is overweight, there's some form of
[49:59] insulin resistance. A lot of times you see these patients and their dad is diabetic. So you don't have to look in
[50:06] your mom's side of the family. This is a very important point both sides. A lot of people just do the direct one to one and they assume, well,
[50:12] if my mother had no fertility issues and she wasn't overweight and wasn't
[50:18] diabetic, didn't seem to have type 2 diabetes, then it's not an issue, but yeah, dad's genetics are critical as
[50:23] well. And then the last uh pillar is epigenetics, which I know you talk a lot about it, but it's our stress. How much
[50:32] are we sleeping? What kind of food are we eating? Right? Someone said this to
[50:37] me, and I love this saying. They said, "Your genes load the gun. Your environment pulls the trigger."
[50:44] And I love that because even if you're loaded with insulin resistance, all of that, you can suppress these symptoms,
[50:51] but if you start eating unhealthy, if you're stressed out, if you're not sleeping, if you're just not exercising
[50:57] right, you're pulling that trigger. And that's why, Andrew, all these pillars
[51:04] work together. And that's why these patients present so many different ways,
[51:10] right? And when you were talking about mood, why does someone feel bad? Why
[51:15] does a PCOS first of all the androgens do affect disrupt the dopamine and
[51:21] serotonin in their brain? That's a fact. But put yourself in the shoes of a PCOS
[51:27] young girl who lives at home with a thin, beautiful mom or a thin, beautiful
[51:33] older sister. She's overweight. She doesn't eat anything. She's
[51:41] exercising every day. She's already a little anxious. She has acne. Her mom
[51:47] takes her and they put her on Accutane. She's constantly lasering her hair. Her
[51:52] periods are completely unpredictable. She's starting to have an eating disorder because nothing she does is
[51:58] working for her, right? And then you take this patient with
[52:04] everything I told you with all these underlying pillars not working in her.
[52:10] You take her to the doctor and she gets dismissed. That's why I'm here to speak for them. I
[52:16] feel like over the past 25 years their trauma has become my trauma. I literally
[52:22] can cry right now. It's clear how much you care about your patients and the ones that are not even
[52:28] your patients. just the women out there that are suffering in this way. I uh perhaps um could we explore the
[52:35] possibility of a different if I say phenotype it may make it sounds so clinical uh but but a different person
[52:41] who um perhaps is only experiencing a subset of those symptoms that you just described um and and on that note I'm
[52:49] struck by the fact that you know what we know from male pattern baldness and female pattern baldness is that when
[52:55] androgens get too high it miniaturizes the hair follicle. It's kind of interesting that when androgens get too
[53:02] high in the ovary, they miniaturaturize the follicle there, too. It seems like that basically excessive androgens are
[53:08] bad for follicle development. It Yeah. So, two parallel pathways operating in the exact same way. Um, it
[53:14] sounds like we're trying to make high testosterone the issue, but in some sense, unless we think back to the the
[53:21] G&R neurons firing too much, the elevated androgens really seem to be the the kind of tip of the spear in this
[53:27] whole thing. not what initially sets off the cascade, but in terms of of tractable things that good medications
[53:33] and good practices might be able to take hold of. Correct. Is that right? And and certainly insulin sensitivity as well. But um so I'm imagining, you know, a
[53:41] bunch of different uh patient profiles here, but I can imagine women in their 20s, in their 30s who have been told by
[53:48] society, okay, you're still fertile, you're good. You're going to be fine. These are the women that are showing up
[53:53] in clinics in their late 30s and 40s and saying, you know, why is it that, you know, my egg count is so low or why is
[53:59] it that I can't conceive? So PCOS patients, their egg count is falsely high because of that, you know,
[54:06] these tiny follicles that are frozen in the ovaries that never got to ovulate, they do secrete AMH.
[54:13] So these patients that's why in 2023 they changed that second criteria the PCOS ovaries to elevated or elevated
[54:21] AMH. How high for for AMH? I mean sometimes I like a norm let's say what's a typical value for someone in
[54:27] their 20s and 30s? So I would say up to six is normal and people in their 40s
[54:32] less than one it drops precipitously. Yes. Where is the the the I don't want to say cliff
[54:38] because maybe it's more gradual than that. after probably late 20s it starts declining. That's why I always tell patients,
[54:44] especially PCOS patients, to freeze by 28 to 30 even though they have tons of eggs. Listen, I get patients, they come
[54:50] to my office, they're like, "Doctor, new patient." I went to my fertility doctor. He doesn't know what he's doing. Why? 40,
[54:57] 41 year old. I put out 30 eggs and he couldn't make a single embryo
[55:03] through IVF. Yeah. Through IVF. You shouldn't put out 30 eggs at age 40. That's PCOS. This is so
[55:09] important for people to hear because I think egg count and elevated or high enough AMH is is sort of touted as the
[55:16] thing that people go and look at. It makes sense, right? I mean, they'll do an ultrasound, count count follicles.
[55:21] It's great as long as you're not missing PCOS because if you're if it's PCOS, then the quality of the embryo is bad,
[55:28] then the ovulation is suboptimal, the environment is suboptimal, and everything else needs to be fixed. And
[55:34] this is perhaps why some people go in in their their 30s, they might be doing IVF or something like that and they actually
[55:39] have relatively low egg count. They'll get, you know, maybe I don't want it's always tricky what what what low
[55:44] correspondence, but you know, three and and two, you know, three on one side, two on the other, but then the IVF works
[55:50] because you you don't necessarily need the quality of the eggs is higher, right? So, AMH, antimmalarian hormone,
[55:57] the easiest way to look at it is every uh 0.1 of AMH averages to one follicle.
[56:05] That's an easy way to calculate it in your head. Okay? So, if you have an AMH of one, you you should have about 10
[56:11] follicles. But if you show up at 40 and there's 30 follicles in your ovaries, something's wrong. That's PCOS. You have
[56:17] to make sure it's not PCOS. have to make sure that you're not missing PCOS because that's why this woman is not,
[56:24] you know, getting pregnant. And can I tell you, Andrew, how many patients come
[56:29] through fertility clinic and they're not diagnosed with PCOS even by their
[56:35] fertility doctor? Well, the way you're describing the the sort of standards in the medical
[56:40] profession, it's it's both not surprising and really umad disheartening. Yeah, it's it's really
[56:46] sad. again why one of the reasons you're here today. I think this reframing of AMH and and egg number um or or follicle
[56:54] number is very important for people to hear. uh because um you know I know a number of different people done IVF do
[57:00] IVF and and this issue of of AMH and and follicle number is like kind of held as
[57:06] the thing right and 50 oh my goodness someone still has you know 20 20 follicles at age whatever you know um 41
[57:14] or something and then and then they have they'll go through rounds of IVF and it's just it's it's I'm not a fertility specialist but I can
[57:21] tell you if at age 25 28 every three um
[57:26] eggs make one embryo. At 40, you might need 10 to 15 eggs to make one embryo.
[57:35] So if your AMH at 40 is 0.5, that means
[57:40] five follicles. So you might have to do two or three cycles of egg freezing or embryo freezing
[57:48] before you can hit that normal embryo. So that's why unfortunately insurance
[57:54] companies don't cover egg freezing, right? And I always say this when uh
[58:00] girls are young and they have beautiful eggs and their eggs are young and healthy and you want to freeze them,
[58:05] they can't afford it because it's very expensive and then when they can afford it, they're usually in their late 30s or
[58:12] 40s and the quality is down. So that needs to be fixed. And we had this conversation, I think, in the Bay Area.
[58:18] A lot of these big companies like Google and Facebook and these companies actually pay for their employees to
[58:24] freeze their eggs. They're smart, right? They don't want their employees to get pregnant. They're like, "I'll pay for your egg freezing. Keep working." But
[58:31] most women most women don't have access. And let me tell you, 50% of counties in
[58:38] this country don't have an OBGYn. 50% 50% of counties.
[58:44] A lot of these women have to drive two to four hours to see their OB/GYN.
[58:51] That's crazy. That's why these podcasts are a gamecher because if they don't have access, that's why artificial
[58:58] intelligence AI, these robotic chat bots that hopefully can someday diagnose
[59:04] these patients and treat them, you know, from home without having them
[59:10] have to drive, I don't know, four hours to see an OB/GYN who will then also dismiss their symptoms.
[59:16] Yeah, like you said, in some cases, technology may be better than certain physicians. I don't disagree with you there. At the end of this podcast,
[59:21] you'll believe in the robots treating Well, I'll believe in in in robots and technologies perhaps doing better than
[59:28] some clinicians and scientists to be fair. But I do think that spectacularly good
[59:33] clinicians like yourself and in other fields. I mean, I know people in different fields of medicine. I'm fortunate enough blessed to know people
[59:40] in different fields of medicine for whom you can truly say that there's no world
[59:46] where a robot or even 15 doctors can compare because there's something about
[59:52] you know knowing the principles of something knowing the principles below the principles principles below that and then being a longtime practitioner in a
[59:58] given field. Yeah. You know like true what we call true expertise deep expertise and lateral
[01:00:04] expertise. No, I was going to say, you know, most fields of medicine, let's take opthalmology, right? Every single
[01:00:11] opthalmologist knows about cataract. Yes. Most common form of of blindness.
[01:00:17] Thank you. So, it would be rare for you to go to an opthalmologist with cataract
[01:00:22] and not get diagnosed. Correct. Correct. So, why is it that the leading cause of infertility on this planet, 90% of women
[01:00:29] are not diagnosed? Women's health is very different than other fields of medicine. It's very it's a different
[01:00:36] monster. It's that cataract patient that goes to 20
[01:00:42] opthalmologist and she keeps saying, "I can't see." And the opthalmologist says,
[01:00:47] "You're crazy. There's nothing wrong with you." Now, that's an excellent analogy. Not not just because it's vision and that's
[01:00:53] my home area of science, but because I think humans are so dependent on vision.
[01:00:58] And just the idea of losing vision is uh for people who are cited is uh so
[01:01:04] challenging. Oh, I mean the number of of incredibly elegant feedback loops and
[01:01:09] the way the whole thing works like a beautiful symphony when it works also indicates that like small disruptions in
[01:01:16] these things are can cause um really downstream consequences. I'm curious why
[01:01:22] so much more PCOS or is it like so many areas of medicine where it probably was
[01:01:27] around a long time but uh we just weren't aware and you know I can point to the insulin resistance maybe it's how
[01:01:33] people are eating and they the downstream chronic inflammation from the traceral fat maybe it's the neuroscientist in me I keep thinking of
[01:01:40] these G&R neurons in the brain that are suddenly start firing abnormally
[01:01:45] you know I have all sorts of pet theories as to why that could be the case but of course I don't have any any data This affects it for sure.
[01:01:52] Disrupted sleepwake cycles. I would sort of default to that. But then you see these young girls who
[01:01:57] grow up in amazing loving families. They've never had any stress. They're you know they didn't have any trauma.
[01:02:04] They're sleeping well. They're eating well. Yeah. But they they start having these symptoms. The reason I'm saying
[01:02:10] this, I don't want um people to get this message that stress is starting all this
[01:02:17] because they really it's a it's a multi-system dysfunction. It's an immune
[01:02:22] system dysfunction. It's a insulin resistant dysfunction. It's a brain pituitary, ovary dysfunction. It's has a
[01:02:30] genetic factor. It has an epigenetic. And that's why the treatment plan is so
[01:02:36] important. That's why you can't throw birth control at all these pillars and
[01:02:42] say, "All right, see you later." Also, birth control means many, many things, right? I mean, there's the I love birth control, but you know,
[01:02:49] well, nowadays there's a bit of a push back. I noticed at least on Instagram for what it's worth. Um, sometimes we
[01:02:55] think Instagram is the whole world and I'll tell you everyone, it's not the whole world. There are a lot of people who are not on Instagram all the time,
[01:03:00] but many are. Um, and there seems to be a bit of a push back against um,
[01:03:05] certainly hormone based contraception. A lot of women um, I I hear from are convinced that it somehow they believe
[01:03:12] it damaged them and and I believe them. That's when the topic of endometriosis will come up and I would love to talk
[01:03:18] about that. But the reason birth control pills work for PCOS patients, it's one
[01:03:25] of the aspects. I don't like birth control pills for PCOS patients. Remember I told you they're moody
[01:03:30] patients. they're they have an anxiety, they're depressed. Um it's hard for them
[01:03:36] to take birth control pills in my opinion. A lot of times they complain of I'm eating more or I don't feel well or
[01:03:43] I'm more depressed or so I it's not my first go-to treatment, but I will tell
[01:03:48] you why it works. Remember I told you the ovaries are um the sex hormone
[01:03:54] binding globbulin goes down because of that high insulin. Birth control pills stimulate that sex hormone binding
[01:04:00] lobbulin that starts grabbing the testosterone and helps with their
[01:04:05] symptoms. That's why if you go to the doctor and you say I have acne, they're like birth control. I have hair loss, birth control. My periods are irregular.
[01:04:12] Birth control. We use it for all everything, right? But it does work to treat the symptoms of PCOS. It makes the
[01:04:19] periods regular. It helps with the skin. It helps with the hair loss. It helps with all of that. This is estrogen based
[01:04:25] or progesterine based birth control. You can do both estrogen and progesterone or there's a progesterone only birth control pill now
[01:04:32] called slend that helps with um it's very anti-androgenic that I try for PCOS
[01:04:38] patients who don't want to you know need a method of birth control but when it comes to treatment you have to hit the
[01:04:45] underlying um pillars right so we talked about the
[01:04:50] epigenetics I always start with there with that exercise walking after each
[01:04:56] meal meal, you know, walk for 10, 15 minutes. Make sure you're sleeping well.
[01:05:01] Make sure your diet is healthy. You're not eating inflammatory foods. You're avoiding, you know, u processed foods.
[01:05:09] Um, so lower your stress. So, you deal with that, but that doesn't work for
[01:05:15] these patients. That's why you need to address everything else. Insulin resistance is one of the main pillars
[01:05:21] that needs to be addressed. You have to lower that insulin because if you lower that insulin, you're lowering visceral
[01:05:27] fat. You're lowering inflammation. You're lowering the ovaries from secretreting androgens, right? So that
[01:05:34] insulin needs to be lowered. That's why a lot of PCOS patients get prescribed
[01:05:40] metformin, right? What does metformin do? Metformin basically makes us more
[01:05:46] insulin sensitive. It's opening these channels. So sugar clears the blood and goes into the cells where it turns into
[01:05:53] energy. Is it high dose metformin or low? No, high dose. High dose I mean I start patients on 750 twice a day but you have
[01:06:01] to start slow because uh PCOS patients especially the ones with insulin resistance which is 80% of them. Um I
[01:06:10] start with 750 because it can cause sometimes GI symptoms like diarrhea and it can also cause nausea. So I start
[01:06:16] with 750 at night. Then if they tolerate it, I um add the 7:50 in the morning.
[01:06:23] And for patients who um are tolerating it and they still are not ovulating,
[01:06:29] their periods are still not regulating and they still have symptoms, I might up it to a thousand twice a day. But you
[01:06:35] see these patients who come in on 500 milligram of PC uh of metformin once a day. That's not going to touch these
[01:06:42] patients. So metformin is one. But before Metformin and I don't know if you know this because of my passion for PCOS
[01:06:49] I actually developed a calculator it's called it's a platform called OV women
[01:06:54] can go on it obviously I can't diagnose on the on any website but I can tell
[01:07:01] them that ask them it's my algorithm that I've developed over the past 25 years and I can tell them very closely
[01:07:08] whether or not they have the likelihood of having PCOS. M
[01:07:14] so that it's there it's ov.com ovi.com it's free they answer some questions questions and I tell them whether they
[01:07:20] have the likelihood or you know if they're less likely to have PCOS and if they do PCOS is one of the very few
[01:07:28] conditions in medicine where supplements make a huge difference and these are for
[01:07:34] patients who don't have access to the doctor and these are patients who basically go to the doctor and they're
[01:07:41] not being they're being dismissed these These supplements work amazingly well. Why? Because um the OV supplement I
[01:07:49] created, I literally did it here. Diagnose yourself and if you're being dismissed, start with the supplement.
[01:07:55] They make a huge difference for these patients. Why? Because they address the
[01:08:01] insulin sensitivity. I'm sure you've heard of anacettol, different forms of anacettol that work um to uh to increase
[01:08:08] sensitivity to insulin. And that's why these patients when they take it, they say, "Oh, my periods became regular or I
[01:08:15] took it and I got pregnant." Because it does address that when it comes to this
[01:08:20] insulin resistance. They can either do the metformin, but what I like to do, I
[01:08:26] like to start them on supplements that has inactol in it and sub vitamin D. Did
[01:08:33] you know that low vitamin D makes you insulin resistant? Well, I'm convinced that I I was aware, but I think it's it
[01:08:40] can't be stated enough or emphatically enough because, you know, I know I'm always I'm really bullish about this
[01:08:46] sunlight thing. I'm always talking about sunlight. I don't want people to get sunburn. That's not what I'm talking about. But we spend so much more time
[01:08:52] indoors now under artificial lighting where the short wavelength lighting, everyone's low. It really disrupts how
[01:08:58] the mitochondria process energy and the long wavelength light from sunlight, the so-called red and infrared light serves
[01:09:05] as a protective feature against the short wavelength light. So, we're not getting enough vitamin D and we need that. That comes from the short
[01:09:10] wavelength light. I do have a question about inositol. Um there are a couple different forms. Uh there's my right. Um
[01:09:17] and and we can explore those in more depth. Um but um it is a well-known uh
[01:09:23] regulator and and can improve um insulin sensitivity, which is what you want.
[01:09:29] Sometimes people hear insulin sensitivity and they think that's the bad thing. You want your insulin to be sensitive.
[01:09:34] You don't want it to be resistant, right? Anything that will make you more insulin sensitive will help with symptoms of
[01:09:40] PCOS. So you want to bring down these pillars, right? without even thinking
[01:09:46] about birth control pill. You want to lower your insulin resistance. So
[01:09:52] whether it's metformin or supplements or exercise or low carbohydrate diet or
[01:09:57] lowering your stress and lowering your cortisol, all of that all of this system. That's why I wanted to explain
[01:10:03] all this because they all work together. Then you want to bring your inflammation down. You want to bring that visceral
[01:10:09] fat down. So you have to that's why I don't know if you heard this but you know in 2014 back then I had trulicity
[01:10:17] as GLP1 and that's what I used to use for my PCOS patients and they would lose 50 60
[01:10:23] 80 100 pounds and this is 2014. What did your colleagues think at that time that you were injecting patients with GLP?
[01:10:29] Um I actually learned it from a cardiologist who I used to work with Dr. Corandi and I used to send because I
[01:10:36] would screen for lipid panel on these PCOS patients and they were all you know we they had high triglycerides and they
[01:10:42] were overweight so I would keep sending them send my patients to him and one day he called me he's like listen ta there's
[01:10:48] this medication called trulicity do not stop sending your patients to me
[01:10:54] treat them with this medication they will lose weight and their cholesterol
[01:10:59] everything will get better so in 2014 I started putting these patients on truly
[01:11:06] and one thing I realized is their periods were getting starting to get regular their symptoms of PCOS would get
[01:11:12] better and the first thing they would come and tell me is doctor I feel less inflamed why do you think because you
[01:11:20] put them on these medications first of all PCOS patients chronically they have this insulin firing right and that's why
[01:11:27] this cascade starts what GLP1s do people think it's It's an appetite suppressant
[01:11:34] and that's how it works. Well, that's that's a side effect of it. But what it does, it actually regulates that
[01:11:39] insulin. So when you eat, it spikes your insulin up and clears that sugar out of
[01:11:45] your blood, right? It's like a scavenger, glucose scavenger, right? And it also makes you insulin
[01:11:50] sensitive. So again, clearing it, which is oxygen really for these PCOS
[01:11:56] patients. That's why I get so upset when patients comment about these GLP ones
[01:12:02] because in this subgroup of patients with insulin resistance who are overweight, who are not ovulating, and
[01:12:08] who have all these symptoms, these medications since 2014 have changed
[01:12:13] their lives in my practice. The push back on GLP1 says there are variety of reasons um probably a discussion for
[01:12:20] another time but they've clearly helped many many people uh as long as people still engage in the right behaviors
[01:12:26] muscle resistance training and people still need to take great care of themselves eat properly exercise sleep
[01:12:32] etc. You mentioned metformin several times. I'm aware of a um of an over-the-counter version called
[01:12:38] bourberine which I believe comes from a tree bark um which is supposed to be a pretty potent glucose scavenger as well.
[01:12:45] Is there any reason why bourberine is not advised? So I think there are some studies that
[01:12:50] say long-term bourberine is not uh advised. The problem with PCOS is it's
[01:12:56] not something it doesn't have a cure. You can't cure it. It's an ongoing issue. That's why you need to be on
[01:13:03] supplements that long term you can stay on and you know like you mentioned vitamin D uh curcumin uh chromium uh um
[01:13:13] anacettol there's so many things we can do to increase that insulin sensitivity
[01:13:18] lower the inflammation in the body I don't usually give bourberine long term but it definitely short term you can use
[01:13:26] it as pulse uh treatment for these patients and metformin it sounds like is a
[01:13:31] relatively safe drug. Is that right? It's very safe. I you know um even for my patients who are not PCOS um I
[01:13:39] recommend um metformin let's say permenopausal women with hemoglobin A1C's in the borderline range you know
[01:13:46] 5.7 you fall into the pre-diabetic range. Um, you know, I'm very lean. I've never been overweight, you know, but I
[01:13:53] have a long family history of diabetes. And, uh, my hemoglobin A1C was, um, 5.6
[01:14:02] a few years ago. And I started taking metformin, and now I'm at 4.8. What um, dosages for people who are
[01:14:09] relatively lean or or lean? I start with like 500 at night just to
[01:14:14] see how they do. Metformin does have side effects and drops your blood sugar, right? And and no, it's mostly like the nausea
[01:14:21] and some people really get really bad diarrhea with it. That's why, you know, um you can I start
[01:14:28] them on the supplements. If it doesn't work, I go to Metformin. If that doesn't work, then I offer them GLP-1s. I see.
[01:14:36] But you can abs and I always ask the patients ask me, can I be on the supplement on uh metformin and on the
[01:14:42] GLP1? Yes. You just don't want to start the GLP ones with the metformin because they both cause nausea and you don't
[01:14:49] know which one's causing what. So if someone's morbidly obese and they really want to lose weight, I I start with the
[01:14:55] GLP1s and usually in about four months, my average since 2014, I can tell you
[01:15:01] four months of GLP1s done correctly, patients lose 24 pounds. That's my that's my uh that's my curve at my
[01:15:09] office of body fat and muscle or probably of muscle too. These patients are a lot of them are like
[01:15:15] they need to lose weight 300 lb. So it's hard to even assess that. But you know what? As they start
[01:15:20] losing weight, they become more motivated because it's the first time in their life that something actually works
[01:15:25] for them because you're actually regulating that insulin dysfunction that they have. And by supporting that, they
[01:15:32] become more active. They their self-esteem gets better. I had a 26-year-old
[01:15:39] in my office who I've been treating for many years for PCOS and these GLP1s and she came into my office a few months ago
[01:15:46] and when I walked in, she was videotaping me. She looked so good. She was so confident. Her hair was done. She
[01:15:51] had a mini skirt with these boots and she was always like, you know, very shy and she wouldn't talk. She was this
[01:15:56] different person that walked into my office. And I started hugging her and she started crying and she looked at me.
[01:16:01] She said, "Dr. This is the first time in my life I know what it means to be happy.
[01:16:07] Wow. Yeah. I mean, it's very clear that these GLP1s can help a lot of people.
[01:16:13] It's interesting that the the push back on GLP1s now is changing a bit because um a number of compoundingies make them
[01:16:20] now. So, you know, people tacked the GLP1s to quote unquote big pharma. You was kind of Yeah. Um and I understand
[01:16:27] people's gripes with big pharma insurance and things. It's, you know, if if everyone has been, you know, boxed
[01:16:32] out of of access to a drug or something like that and in had insurance issues, it could be very, very frustrating, even
[01:16:38] deadly. I mean, there's a whole discussion about this recently around cancer and cancer drugs. But to stay on
[01:16:44] point, I think now that some of these GLP-1 peptides are available through compoundingies, prices have come down.
[01:16:50] The big pharmaceutical companies don't like that. But it's also the case that people are are quote unquote micro doing
[01:16:56] them. They're taking the GLP1s at at doses that are below the threshold that would give them nausea. So, they're not
[01:17:03] losing weight quite as quickly. They're not going gaunt quite as quickly. Um, but nonetheless, they're benefiting from
[01:17:10] I think the appetite suppression, the insulin improved insulin sensitivity, inflammation and reduced inflammation. Yes. And it
[01:17:18] also seems that they adjust something about brain chemistry that make people
[01:17:23] feel better separate. It's impossible to separate it completely, but separate from a lot of the bodily changes.
[01:17:30] There's a bit of an anti-depressant function there. You know why? Because that noise that
[01:17:35] says eat, eat, eat, eat, which is an issue like you know that binge eating.
[01:17:40] I'm just speaking for my PCOS patients cuz I'm not an expert for obesity, but
[01:17:46] uh they have this voice in their head and it's a constant battle from the minute they wake up to the minute they
[01:17:52] go to sleep. And it's not like they're crazy. They're not, it's not like they're, you know, being sloppy with
[01:17:59] food. It's just this this brain disregulation of dopamine and serotonin
[01:18:04] that stimul that causes this brutal anxiety, constant anxiety. And every
[01:18:11] single one of them will tell me my brain is quiet. Wow. They're not drinking as much.
[01:18:17] Yeah. That's a clear quotequote side effect is people don't crave alcoholics. And I've said it for years. Just use it
[01:18:23] on alcoholics. Use it on alcoholics. I had a friend of mine who called me and said her son drinks a lot. The first
[01:18:30] thing I asked is can he tolerate micro doing of ompic because it shuts down
[01:18:36] their cravings because it's in some sense a sugar craving. It's a state craving of being under the influence of alcohol but it
[01:18:42] starts with a craving of sugar. Those two things are very closely paired. But that's why they feel better, right?
[01:18:48] But even without GLP1s, when you diagnose and treat these PCOS patients, their confidence comes back. They feel
[01:18:55] better. They know they're not crazy, which is why I'm here today. You are not crazy. If you're gaining weight, acne,
[01:19:02] hair loss, facial hair, body hair, if you're not getting pregnant, if you can't lose your weight, um none of this,
[01:19:07] you're not crazy. This this had these are the underlying conditions and these vicious cycles need to be addressed. And
[01:19:14] for people that want to get pregnant and treat their PCOS, uh, what are the success rates that
[01:19:20] you've observed in your clinic? Very good question. So, as I'm not a fertility doctor, but I'm trying to take
[01:19:27] these patients out of the hands of the fertility doctors. So, one thing I do, I put them on the supplement uh on my OV
[01:19:34] supplement. I give them metformin and I have them try and try to see if I can
[01:19:39] regulate their period. two things you can do easily and doctors can do it in their office. One is a medication called
[01:19:46] let and the other one is Clomid. Both of those basically um regulate that
[01:19:54] hypothalamus pituitary ovarian axis and pushes these patients to ovulate. With
[01:19:59] letol 60 70% of them I think ovulate and with Clomid it's a little bit less. So
[01:20:05] you can try those in the office for someone who wants to get pregnant. What I usually do, I have them try on their
[01:20:12] own for 6 months to a year depending on their age. If they're above 35, I say 6
[01:20:18] months. If they're less than that and they're not in a hurry and their egg count is good and I've regular and I
[01:20:23] know I've dealt with their PCOS and their inflammation and their insulin resistance, then I have them try for a year, right? Because if you take um 100
[01:20:32] couples regardless of age um and you have them have sex I don't know three times three
[01:20:39] to four times a week 50% of them get pregnant in the first 6 months and 90% of them get pregnant in the first year.
[01:20:45] But for patients with endometriosis or PCOS I usually have them try for like about 6 months and then check back in
[01:20:52] with me. you know if letol clomit uh trying on their own everything fails
[01:20:58] then you can send them to fertility doctors. Uh one thing that I want to bring up here which is my observation
[01:21:05] and it's nowhere in the literature but I'm saying it today and I know it's going to be published someday.
[01:21:11] I strongly believe that over 50% of PCOS
[01:21:16] patients also have endometriosis. Over 50%. And I've always said this, if
[01:21:22] you have a patient with PCOS, think about it. PCOS is already one of the leading causes of infertility. And in my
[01:21:30] opinion, 50% of them, because I I've seen it in my office, have
[01:21:35] endometriosis. And I have a path report and I've done laparoscopic surgery to prove it. If you only address PCOS and
[01:21:44] you're dismissing their painful period, then they're not getting pregnant. That's why you have to
[01:21:52] make sure you put a check in front of all these underlying conditions.
[01:21:58] I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Element. Element is an electrolyte drink
[01:22:03] that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium, all in
[01:22:09] the correct ratios, but no sugar. Proper hydration is critical for brain and body
[01:22:14] function. Even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish your cognitive and physical performance. It's also
[01:22:20] important that you get adequate electrolytes. The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium are vital for
[01:22:26] the functioning of all cells in your body, especially your neurons or your nerve cells. Drinking element makes it
[01:22:31] very easy to ensure that you're getting adequate hydration and adequate electrolytes. My days tend to start
[01:22:37] really fast, meaning I have to jump right into work or right into exercise. So, to make sure that I'm hydrated and I
[01:22:43] have sufficient electrolytes, when I first wake up in the morning, I drink 16 to 32 ounces of water with an element
[01:22:49] packet dissolved in it. I also drink Element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise that I'm
[01:22:54] doing, especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot and losing water and electrolytes. Element has a bunch of
[01:22:59] great tasting flavors. In fact, I love them all. I love the watermelon, the raspberry, the citrus, and I really love
[01:23:04] the lemonade flavor. So, if you'd like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman
[01:23:10] to claim a free Element sample pack with any purchase. Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman
[01:23:16] to claim a free sample pack. Well, I definitely want to talk about endometriosis. Um, before we move to
[01:23:22] that, it sounds like going after the insulin resistance first with metformin
[01:23:28] and oitol, the other things in uh OV. Well, first people should go to the uh
[01:23:34] OVI site. We can put it in the show not take the quiz as it's a zerocost
[01:23:40] platform. You get some feedback there about what might be happening, what's likely happening. Um and then take care
[01:23:46] of the insulin resistance which presumably also includes things you mentioned trying to get best possible
[01:23:51] sleep, limit stress, exercise. Yes. And start with supplements first if
[01:23:56] your symptoms are not bad. You know, I've had like 50some patients get off OV because they got pregnant. All you're
[01:24:03] doing is addressing their hormone and metabolic health. That's all we're doing with it. But if it doesn't work, ask for
[01:24:09] metformin. If it doesn't work and you're you're having a hard time losing weight,
[01:24:16] ask for GLP1s. Ask your doctor for Clomid if you're trying to get pregnant. Ask your doctor for let first, Clomid
[01:24:24] second. And if all that fails, go see a fertility doctor. But before that, even if you're single and you don't have a
[01:24:31] partner and you're in your late 20s and you have no one uh and you know having a
[01:24:37] baby is something that will probably happen few years down the line, consider freezing eggs. Not because of the count,
[01:24:43] because of the quality of the eggs because PCOS patients again have tons of
[01:24:48] eggs but the quality is not that good. Endometriosis is opposite. endometriosis
[01:24:55] destroys your egg count and quality. I've seen a few papers um that suggest
[01:25:00] that co-enzyme Q10 and Lcarnitine might be beneficial for egg quality. Yes. And
[01:25:05] in males sperm quality, but we're talking about eggs here. Um do you include that?
[01:25:11] Yes. And I would say it's probably because of inflammation, right?
[01:25:16] We don't really have great tests for inflammation yet. like the number of tests, you know, that are coming online
[01:25:23] for um evaluating biomarkers is is quite quite impressive, but we don't really
[01:25:29] have a good test for inflammation as we don't have a test for PCOS.
[01:25:34] Wouldn't that be wonderful? But but it sounds like there's no single blood test that would do it because it's a constellation of things.
[01:25:40] That's why patients say, "My doctor said I don't have PCOS because my testosterone is normal." False. My
[01:25:46] doctor said I don't have PCOS because my uh I don't have any cysts on my ovaries. False. My doctor said I don't have PCOS
[01:25:53] because I'm not overweight. False. My doctor says my periods are regular so I'm not I don't have PCOS. False.
[01:25:59] There's so many myths that that's why it's important to understand the four phenotypes and how they differ.
[01:26:06] Understand that 70 to 80% of these patients don't ovulate. understand that that the 20 30% who ovulate ovulate
[01:26:14] sometimes, not all the time and that's why they're not getting pregnant. And understand that inflammation, insulin
[01:26:20] resistance, and this brain ovary axis are the main drivers. And then you add
[01:26:26] genetics and epigenetics, it starts a big chaos in the body. And that's why as
[01:26:31] a clinician, that's why it takes so much time, right? In this health care system,
[01:26:36] when you get 10 minutes with your doctor, do you think your doctor everything we
[01:26:42] talked about? I'd say I teach all of this to my patient, new patients with PCOS. How can you do that in 10 minutes?
[01:26:49] And on top of that, do their papsmear, check their hormones, talk about STD, talk about birth control, rule out
[01:26:55] endometriosis. How are you going to do that? A, patients don't have access to doctors.
[01:27:01] B when they have access either the doctors are not well trained or they
[01:27:06] don't have time to send spend time with these patients and they get you know
[01:27:11] even when they get diagnosed they get prescribed a birth control pill and off you go.
[01:27:18] Yeah. the thin end ed end of the wedge in this case really seems to be going after the insulin resistance um at least
[01:27:25] in terms of what people can do for themselves without you know because people can't start injecting androgen
[01:27:30] blockers without you know the assistance and and guidance of a physician so take
[01:27:35] care of your insulin sensitivity incur you know enrich it encourage it so
[01:27:41] sunlight limit stress sleep etc but these tools of inocl co-enzyme Q10
[01:27:46] lcarnitine and these are in OV supplement. It is amazing. And not speak not because I don't even have time, but I really
[01:27:53] created it for women who are at home who don't know if they have a PCOS and they
[01:27:59] don't know what to do. This is the least you can do. Eat healthy, exercise, sleep well, lower your stress, take the OV
[01:28:06] supplement, but before you do all that, take the quiz. And if you want future fertility,
[01:28:12] freeze, freeze, freeze before 30 and know your egg count. What about for women who are older than 30 who want to
[01:28:19] freeze eggs? Does it make sense for them to freeze at 35? It seems to me the answer would be yes. Oh, always. I always freeze because you
[01:28:26] need one good egg. Mhm. And you don't know if you're going to get it or not, but freeze. And PCOS
[01:28:32] patients, the beauty of it is they have all these follicles, so we can pull out a lot of eggs. Now, the quality might
[01:28:38] not be good, but keep pulling it. So for my PCOS patients, generally speaking, we
[01:28:43] I always tell my patients, freeze 20 eggs because 20 is safe. But as you get
[01:28:48] older, especially if you have PCOS, I might want 40 eggs. You know, the more
[01:28:53] you have because I know the quality is not that good. Well, and considering that you're going to get more the younger the patient is
[01:29:02] um and that freezing eggs is not a zerocost endeavor, it starts to get more expensive as you get older essentially,
[01:29:08] right? So the incentive to do it younger is that it's going to be less expensive in the long run. Um I mean there are
[01:29:15] women in their late 30s, early 40s who still try to freeze eggs. I think in in the state of California after age 42 you
[01:29:22] can only freeze embryos, not eggs. I think it um and I mean it doesn't even make financial sense at that point to do it
[01:29:28] to pay 10, 15, 20,000. I think in Northern California it goes up to like
[01:29:33] 35,000. I mean imagine for one cycle to get two eggs out. Yeah. the probabilities are exceedingly
[01:29:40] low but you can understand why people feel you know this this kind of information even just podcasts in
[01:29:46] general weren't so prominent you know six seven years ago I mean they were podcasts were around but these sorts of
[01:29:52] discussions weren't happening no this is amazing what you're doing I don't think you'll see this podcast will
[01:29:59] make such a huge difference and I want your male listeners to listen for the sake of their daughters their sisters
[01:30:06] their girlfriends because are wise because this is so common and so
[01:30:12] dismissed and you know I've always said this you're going to laugh but you know what my dream is you'll see I'm going to
[01:30:19] get to my dream is I've always said it I want the president of United States to
[01:30:24] call for 15 minutes of silence in this country and I'm really serious and I
[01:30:29] want him to hand me the mic so I can tell women what they deserve to know to
[01:30:35] tell them that their symptoms are real that their pain is real, that they're not crazy, that it's not in their head,
[01:30:43] that there is something really wrong that needs to be addressed. And if they're being dismissed, they need to
[01:30:49] listen to podcasts like yourself. Come on, GMD podcast. I literally, just like
[01:30:55] you, I take every single condition and I teach them what to do with it. They
[01:31:01] don't need to go to like literally they don't need to come to my office to see me. I'm telling them what to do. But you
[01:31:07] have to teach them to become their own health advocate. Well, this is the the new movement is for people to advocate for their own
[01:31:13] health is a big shift. I think since the pandemic really and um I hear you loud and clear and and also uh folks at AHS
[01:31:21] um health and human services do listen to this podcast. Um about 50% of our our
[01:31:26] listenership is is male. The other 50% is female. Uh it you know distributes
[01:31:32] differently across platforms but that's that's basically the contour of things. And I have a feeling uh you'll get your
[01:31:38] 10 15 uh hopefully more minutes. I know this is my mic today. I feel like
[01:31:43] I'm getting to my dream. Yeah. Well well hopefully it's it's a um a large vertical step toward your
[01:31:49] ultimate dream of of doing that at the um national level although you know we
[01:31:54] are now translated into other languages. So there there is uh the potential for this to go extremely uh far. Thanks
[01:32:01] thanks to the information you're sharing. Okay. So, I definitely want to talk about endometriosis, but before we
[01:32:06] do that, I just want to give people a summary reminder of the two dues. Women
[01:32:13] basically, regardless of age, should go take this OVI test, the self test. Yes.
[01:32:19] Zero cost. Get some answers. Um, get some feedback and then really take
[01:32:24] control of their insulin sensitivity. This is true for everybody, but especially for the people we're talking about here, women that might have PCOS,
[01:32:31] might not interested in their fertility or just broadly interested in their hormone health regardless of age, even
[01:32:37] if they're pmenopause, menopause. Great. The actionables of limit stress,
[01:32:43] excellent sleep in no particular order. limit stress, get the best possible sleep, eat a low inflammation diet,
[01:32:50] limited processed foods, maybe even cut back on starchy carbohydrates to improve insulin sensitivity for make
[01:32:56] sure you're getting enough protein. This kind of thing, exercise, including high intensity and resistance training. And then supplementation.
[01:33:03] You've designed a supplement. I have no relation to it. So that know this isn't a a designated like, you know,
[01:33:08] collaborative promotional, but the point being that it has all the things in it that one would want. It's inositol,
[01:33:15] co-enzyme Q10. It has vitamin D. It has actually um wild malberry leaf in it, which believe
[01:33:21] it or not, if you take it before your heaviest meal, it blocks the absorption of carbohydrates in that meal by 40%. So
[01:33:29] all the things that PCOS patients um really need for that insulin resistance,
[01:33:34] for their inflammation, um you know, we've had so many patients get pregnant on it. So many patients I
[01:33:40] had a patient who called me and said, "My mood is better." Going back to what I was telling you, uh, instead of just
[01:33:45] starting these patients on Zoloft and Lexapro, sometimes when you fix their underlying condition, you might make
[01:33:52] them feel better. Not to dismiss their symptoms, but you can at least start with the more natural ways and then
[01:33:58] prescribe them anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medication. Yeah. Amen to that. And it's interesting
[01:34:04] uh this mulberry um you know I think some people who are more from the uh traditional medical orientation um think
[01:34:12] oh supplements this and that we've had a couple of scientists on this podcast serious laboratory scientists who work
[01:34:19] on things every everything you can imagine from painkillers to things that
[01:34:24] are uh you know active in the brain to improve mood regulate appetite
[01:34:30] pharma and the drugs they make are derived D almost always from plant
[01:34:35] compounds initially, right? They actually do what's called bioprospecting. They go out and find plants. We rarely hear about this. They
[01:34:41] find plants, then they isolate the alkoids from plants that have potent effects on blood sugar, potent effects
[01:34:47] on on mood, potent effects on pain. And so what we end up with when we talk about pharmaceutical drugs, you know,
[01:34:55] most of them are derived from plants in the first place. In the first place. So when you hear malberry, you think, oh, is this like a
[01:35:00] berry? Is this some magic berry from the jungle? No, this is these are the these uh plant compounds contain uh very
[01:35:08] bioactive elements within them. So that will also reduce uh these uh the
[01:35:13] business of improving insulin sensitivity will uh lower inflammation, right? Very very important. And then of course
[01:35:20] we can't control our genetics but we've been talking about epigenetics. And then if one is poss if one can they should
[01:35:27] really evaluate their egg count AMH with the understanding that high egg count
[01:35:33] and AMH and regular shedding of the uterine lining aka menses menrating does
[01:35:40] not necessarily mean that everything is reproductively normal. Bravo. Okay. Did I get it right? All right.
[01:35:46] You're the best. Oh yeah. Well, I just I just want to make sure that that the audience really understands because these are things
[01:35:51] that people can really take control of and do. Oh, and one other critical thing is um listen to Dr. Aliabati's podcast
[01:35:58] because uh she MD there's a because there's a lot more information there as well.
[01:36:05] Okay, let's talk about endometriosis. What is it? What problems does it create? And what can people do about it?
[01:36:14] devastating devastating condition that affects you know they say 10% I think
[01:36:19] it's north of 20% because they're not diagnosed it's a condition where uh
[01:36:25] tissue similar to the lining of the uterus is outside of the uterus around the
[01:36:32] tubes and ovaries on the bladder on the bowel or inside the ovary right what
[01:36:38] happens is in a simple terms when every month our ovaries are trying to get us pregnant, they secrete estrogen and
[01:36:45] estrogen stimulates the lining of the uterus. When we don't get pregnant, this lining breaks down and comes out as a
[01:36:52] form of period. 10 to I think 20% of women have these cells similar to the
[01:36:58] lining of the uterus outside of the uterus. So once a month when the follicle is secretreting estrogen, these
[01:37:03] cells on the outside get stimulated. And when we don't get pregnant and the lining breaks down, these guys uh break
[01:37:10] down and bleed, but they're bleeding outside of the uterus. Oh, so it's a form of internal bleeding. Correct.
[01:37:15] It's e it's ectopic formation of uterine lining. It's in the wrong place. Correct. Correct. We don't know why
[01:37:22] people have it, but it's extremely common and as I was telling you, I think
[01:37:27] 50% more than 50% of my PCOS patients also have endometriosis. The problem with endometriosis is in
[01:37:35] this country it takes doctors 9 to 11 years to diagnose endometriosis.
[01:37:42] On average patients see 5 to 10 doctors and that's not an exaggeration.
[01:37:48] I've had patients who've seen 50 doctors in this country to get the diagnosis.
[01:37:53] Majority of them go undiagnosed. A lot of them end up in the fertility
[01:37:59] clinics. And I my heart if you spend a day with me in my office, you go home
[01:38:05] with a broken heart because these patients travel from all over the
[01:38:10] country to come. They already know, right? Because a child had GPT, they already know they have endo. They just
[01:38:17] want a physician to validate them. So they will fly to come because they want
[01:38:24] someone to say, "Yes, you're not crazy. you have endometriosis and yes, there's a treatment and it's
[01:38:30] not in your head. The problem is these patients talk about dismissal.
[01:38:36] I can't even tell you the devastating side effects of this prolonged dismissal
[01:38:43] because no one wants to sit down and just listen to them. You do not need a
[01:38:48] fancy blood test. There's no blood test for endometriosis. You don't need an ultrasound. You don't need anything to
[01:38:54] diagnose endometriosis. You just have to listen. I met this gentleman in Paris who told me he has this blood test
[01:39:00] that's 95% accurate that he's going to release it. This is was few years ago.
[01:39:05] And I was like, great, that's great because we need a blood test. But then when I, you know, was um flying home, I
[01:39:13] was thinking to myself, my accuracy is 99.9% just by listening to the patient.
[01:39:18] You don't need any fancy tools to diagnose. You can self diagnose yourself at home. How do you diagnose? The first
[01:39:26] thing I want to teach your listeners is painful periods are not normal.
[01:39:31] You know, one time for my 50th birthday, I wanted to get um uh what do you call
[01:39:37] it? On the freeways, uh I wanted to get like 10 billboards for
[01:39:43] my birthday and just put painful periods are not normal # endometriosis. That was
[01:39:49] my birthday gift for myself. I wanted to do that. But then my daughter, my second daughter came up to me. She's like,
[01:39:54] "Mom, okay. So you tell them painful periods is not normal." They go to their doctor and the doctor says, "Yes, it's normal. Don't worry about it." Then
[01:40:00] what? I'm like, "So maybe going down the freeway, the next one will say, if you
[01:40:06] have endometriosis, check your egg." And if you have endometriosis on the third, and I was, you know, I was going to just
[01:40:12] treat them as they drive down the freeway. That's how bad it is. So painful periods are not normal. Could
[01:40:18] you distinguish between painful periods and premenstrual cramping? Correct. So, what do I mean by painful
[01:40:24] period? If the pain disrupts your life, if you're skipping school, if you're
[01:40:32] calling in sick and you can't go to work, if you're staying in bed, if you
[01:40:37] change your social plans around your periods, if you're ending up in the
[01:40:42] emergency room or an urgent care because your periods are painful, that's not
[01:40:48] normal. If sex with deep penetration hurts, that's not normal. If you're
[01:40:55] constantly bloated, even during the month when your periods are painful and
[01:41:00] after your periods you eat and you're constantly bloated, that's not normal. If when you have a bowel movement, your
[01:41:07] bowel movement hurts, that's not normal. If you constantly end up in your gyn or
[01:41:12] primary care's office complaining of UTI or bladder symptoms, recurrent bladder
[01:41:19] symptoms, and you're getting antibiotics three, four, five times, six times, 10
[01:41:26] times a year with a negative culture, that's endometriosis until proven
[01:41:31] otherwise. So because these patients present differently, majority of these symptoms are chronic
[01:41:38] pain though. It's the top cause of chronic pelvic pain in women. It's the
[01:41:43] leading cause of infertility. Right? Over hundred years ago
[01:41:51] they knew about endometriosis. 100 years later we're still not
[01:41:57] diagnosing these patients correctly. 100 years later, these women go through
[01:42:02] life. They can't have children. They have chronic pelvic pain. They stay
[01:42:07] home. They get anxious. They get depressed. They get addicted to opioids because when they go to the doctor, they
[01:42:13] end up in these pain clinics and someone starts prescribing them uh Norco or
[01:42:18] Percoet. I have 25 year olds who come to my office, they're like, I know Percoet is not going to help me. I don't want to
[01:42:24] take this, but this is what the urgent care gave me. That sounds like malpractice to me.
[01:42:29] But it is. But it is. And you know what? I I I think people think I'm crazy, but
[01:42:34] you know what I wanted to do, which I'm never going to do, but intent to sue letter to send to all the doctors who've
[01:42:41] dismissed my patients because if you get one of those letters, maybe you maybe it'll wake you up. We have to do
[01:42:47] something. How, you know, can I tell you something, Andrew? If men, think about this, had a condition that
[01:42:56] would cause them to have severe pain during sex. It would scar their
[01:43:02] scrotums. It would lower their sperm count. It would be the top cause of
[01:43:07] their fertil infertility that they would stay home 2, three days out of the month
[01:43:13] in bed. They would end up in emergency rooms few times a year, right?
[01:43:20] They would get bloated, anxious, depressed from the pain. Do you think
[01:43:25] majority of them would go undiagnosed? No. The the problem would be dealt with very differently. And I say that with um
[01:43:32] with certainty because if you look at the just even the speed with which certain uh drugs have been approved uh
[01:43:38] in the medical community like Viagra for instance, one of the fastest approvals for new uses. I mean some of those drugs
[01:43:45] like were developed for other purposes but male specific health has uh does um
[01:43:52] receive a sort of acceleration um and and we know that the in the
[01:43:57] research community it started about 10 years back there was a requirement actually to get grants funded that um
[01:44:03] that people evaluate both sexes. So believe it or not, it was all done on male mice for large largely male uh
[01:44:09] done. That changed um now with changes in the way that you know um science is
[01:44:15] being done and funded. This is this issue has become prominent again. But everything I'm saying here is just in in
[01:44:20] uh total agreement. Yeah, it it would have been um it would have been considered a national emergency.
[01:44:26] It would have been right. I saw a patient I mean I have thousands of these stories. I have literally I have trauma
[01:44:32] from it. I have PTSD from it. I saw a patient last week in my office, 50 years old. Um, the first thing she said when I
[01:44:40] walked in, she said, "I asked you a favor." I said, "What?" She said, "Don't call me crazy. I'm not crazy." And I
[01:44:48] didn't mark anxiety because I didn't want you to blame my symptoms for my anxiety. And I looked at her, I'm like,
[01:44:54] "This is the last office I would I would be the last person standing on this planet that would do that to you." as as
[01:45:01] I started listening to her classic endometriosis patient. She's 50 years old, painful periods. She said, "I've
[01:45:09] been to hundred emergency rooms. I know every emergency room in every country I've ever visited. I've um she never got
[01:45:16] married cuz she had painful sex. She couldn't have sex. She had severe pain. She would stay at home. She would lose
[01:45:23] her jobs, right? Um never had children. Just chronic pain. completely anxious,
[01:45:31] guarded, right? Shows up to my office. I'm probably the hundth doctor she's
[01:45:37] seen. And all she wanted to hear me say is, "You have endometriosis."
[01:45:44] This is the story of these patients. I you can't even make these stories up. It's unbelievable and yet believable.
[01:45:51] And I don't want to sound like somebody who's super suspicious of of the medical community or pharma. I think most
[01:45:57] physicians have good intentions. I think that like you said they they the culture
[01:46:02] and climate within the field, the way insurance is handled, all these things I think railroad people into a kind of a
[01:46:08] conveyor belt type of of practice. But I can also say that because I know some
[01:46:13] excellent physicians like yourself and some people I've known for for um a very long time in other fields that really
[01:46:20] good physicians read the literature. They integrate what they know from their clinical practice. They talk to other
[01:46:26] physicians. They they're part of a community that's trying to evolve itself, but that's usually a subculture
[01:46:31] within the culture. And most people don't know how to find the right people. Although with podcasts, they're starting
[01:46:36] to. The problem with endometriosis is it's so common and we don't have enough
[01:46:42] doctors diagnosing it. And like I said, a lot of these women don't even have an
[01:46:47] access to an OB/GYN. And when they go there, 95% of the time they're not even
[01:46:55] diagnosed. And if they're diagnosed, they're not even treated correctly. So what happens these ectopic implants,
[01:47:02] right, that are in the pelvis. It's very strange because I mean, we don't know why some women have endometriosis and
[01:47:09] some don't. It could be. There's so many hypothesis, but the most common one is probably retrograde menstruation, which
[01:47:15] a lot of women uh get, which means when we're having our period, some of that blood goes through the tubes and out
[01:47:22] into the pelvis and implants there. In a regular healthy immune system will get
[01:47:28] rid of those implants. But for whatever reason in this subgroup of patients
[01:47:34] their inflammatory their their immune system doesn't work well. It actually
[01:47:40] helps start an inflammatory process around these implants that make it stick to the
[01:47:47] wall of the pelvis. May I ask? So, um I think I have the picture right where the the the uterine
[01:47:53] lining either heads up the fallopian tubes as opposed to being shed uh of outward out of the body basically um and
[01:48:01] then it actually gets out into the extracellular space. So would it be cleared by the lymphatic system?
[01:48:06] Yes. And by their immune system they come they're eat Yes. But in in these patients,
[01:48:14] not only they don't take them away, they stimulate them to stick to the walls of the pelvis. That's number one. Then
[01:48:21] these little implants need estrogen to grow. Right? Remember I told you the ovaries are secretting estrogen. So they
[01:48:29] start making their own estrogen, right? So locally they support
[01:48:35] themselves without needing systemic estrogen. Right?
[01:48:40] And then they start, you know, they increase vascularity to the lesion and
[01:48:47] then they start um growing nerve uh fibers around them each lesion.
[01:48:54] It's almost as if they're like everything you're saying resembles tumor formation.
[01:48:59] It's just I always say it acts like cancer, but it's not. Let's say you have a patient with colon
[01:49:04] cancer. You go and you reect the colon cancer. You never tell them, "Okay, sir, I'll see you in 6 months. he'll be back
[01:49:10] with colon cancer everywhere. You have to give him chemo. Endometriosis is not cancer, but you have to treat it the
[01:49:16] same way. What I mean by that is once you go in laparoscopically and cut these lesions out, you have to give it
[01:49:22] hormonal suppression. Otherwise, it comes back. I see. So, we can get to that. But these
[01:49:29] implants are self-limited, right? They basically have vessels that's feeding
[01:49:36] them. They make their own estrogen. they start an inflammatory process in that area and they start growing right every
[01:49:43] month they get more and more uh they progress more as we age that's why these patients average age of diagnosis for
[01:49:50] endometriosis is 32 and it takes doctors 9 to 11 years to diagnose these patients
[01:49:56] because it can start with oh my periods are painful then they get more painful then you start staying home then you
[01:50:03] have to call your mom to pick you up from school then sex starts hurting Then you realize a week before it starts
[01:50:09] hurting. Then you realize now a week after the pain is still there and eventually it turns into chronic pelvic
[01:50:15] pain. But these patients jump from doctor to doctor to doctor until a they
[01:50:20] have chronic pelvic pain and someone says wait a minute you have endometriosis or b they can't get
[01:50:26] pregnant and they end up where in the fertility clinics for something that could have been suppressed years prior
[01:50:32] to that. Let's say they end up in an IVF clinic. they're able to create healthy embryos they implant. How does endometriosis
[01:50:39] impact the uh probability of carrying that embryo to successful?
[01:50:44] So it depends on the age on the quality of the eggs. One thing endometriosis does so endometriosis is an inflammatory
[01:50:51] process. It causes inflammation in the pelvis. That's why as it progresses it
[01:50:56] causes scarring in the pelvis. It can cause scarring of the tubes. That inflammation can affect your egg
[01:51:03] quality. can cause bowel adhesions, bladder adhesions. If it's inside the
[01:51:08] ovary, we call it endometrioma or a chocolate cyst that can destroy a
[01:51:14] woman's egg count and quality. That's why sometimes you get a 30-year-old endometriosis patient who has zero eggs
[01:51:21] or you can have a 14year-old who has the egg count of a 40year-old. So, it is
[01:51:26] absolutely crucial crucial for endometriosis patients to know their egg
[01:51:32] count. If they have no pain, get a baseline at age 18. If you have painful
[01:51:38] periods and you're 14, get an egg count. Rule out endometriosis.
[01:51:45] You can have an eight-year-old with endometriosis. Now, it's very rare, right? But as soon as women start
[01:51:50] menstruating, they can start complaining of these pains. Now, it's common for
[01:51:55] patients to have some cramps. You they might take a couple of Advils and it's fine. But if pain becomes recurrent and
[01:52:04] it starts progressing and it's disrupting the their life, then it's absolutely not normal. It's
[01:52:10] endometriosis until proven otherwise. Which takes me to my other discussion.
[01:52:16] We're discussing doctors don't do ultrasound. Not that you can diagnose endometriosis on ultrasound, but if you
[01:52:22] have an endometrioma or a chocolate cyst, which takes you to approximately a stage three out of four endometriosis,
[01:52:29] you can see it in two seconds on ultrasound. So if you do an ultrasound and you see an endometrioma, I don't
[01:52:36] care how small it is, don't ignore it. It's just like me saying, "I see smoke
[01:52:41] here, but I'm going to ignore it because I don't see the fire." Well, if you see smoke, you know there's fire. Go check
[01:52:46] it out. And that's exactly what happens with endo patients because they go dismissed. They show up at age 30. They
[01:52:53] have no eggs. Their tubes are scarred. And to answer your question, once you a
[01:52:58] lot of these patients because of that inflammation, the environment is hostile. So the reason it's one of the
[01:53:04] top causes of infertility, yes, your tubes can get blocked. Yes, your egg count and quality can drop. that the
[01:53:11] environment is so hostile for the sperm, for that little egg that's getting
[01:53:17] released that needs to be picked up by the tube that can get attacked by these inflammatory cells. The embryo sometimes
[01:53:23] doesn't form. If it forms, it might get stuck in the tube and you might end up with an ectopic pregnancy or if it goes
[01:53:29] into the uterus, all that inflammation increases the risk of miscarriage. And
[01:53:34] on top of that a large percentage of endometriosis
[01:53:40] patients have adenomiiosis which is the sister condition to endometriosis which is very common. You don't not all
[01:53:47] adnomiiosis patients have endometriosis but a lot of endometriosis patients have adinomiiosis
[01:53:53] and adnomiiosis is when these ectopic tissue the uh lining inside the uterus
[01:53:59] are in the wall of the uterus. So they do get stimulated and they can cause heavy periods. They
[01:54:06] can cause recurrent miscarriages. They can cause um painful periods and it also
[01:54:13] gets dismissed on ultrasound. A lot of doctors depend on MRIs to diagnose adnomiiosis where if you've done enough
[01:54:19] ultrasounds, you can start seeing it on a pelvic ultrasound. But the problem is a lot of radiologists don't know how to
[01:54:25] diagnose it. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors,
[01:54:31] Function. Last year, I became a Function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing.
[01:54:37] Function provides over 100 advanced lab tests that give you a key snapshot of your entire bodily health. This snapshot
[01:54:44] offers you with insights on your heart health, hormone health, immune functioning, nutrient levels, and much
[01:54:49] more. They've also recently added tests for toxins such as BPA exposure from harmful plastics and tests for PASES or
[01:54:56] forever chemicals. Function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to your physical and mental health,
[01:55:02] but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from top doctors who are expert in the relevant areas. For
[01:55:09] example, in one of my first tests with function, I learned that I had elevated levels of mercury in my blood. function
[01:55:15] not only helped me detect that, but offered insights into how best to reduce my mercury levels, which included
[01:55:20] limiting my tuna consumption. I'd been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and
[01:55:26] supplementing with knack and acetylcyine, both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification. And I should say by
[01:55:32] taking a second function test, that approach worked. Comprehensive blood testing is vitally important. There's so
[01:55:38] many things related to your mental and physical health that can only be detected in a blood test. The problem is
[01:55:43] blood testing has always been very expensive and complicated. In contrast, I've been super impressed by Function's
[01:55:49] simplicity and at the level of cost. It is very affordable. As a consequence, I decided to join their scientific
[01:55:55] advisory board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast. If you'd like to try Function, you can go to
[01:56:00] functionhealth.com/huberman. Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people, but they're
[01:56:07] offering early access to Huberman podcast listeners. Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[01:56:13] to get early access to function. Can I ask a naive question about ultrasound and and diagnosis and just
[01:56:19] women's health in general? And forgive me for not knowing the answer to this, but I don't. So I'm going to you know um
[01:56:26] swallow my pride and just ask what is the current state of of of
[01:56:33] medical care in this country for women such that let's say a woman is in her doesn't matter 20s 30s 40s 50s whatever
[01:56:39] and wants to go get a pelvic exam with ultrasound a blood draw to look at AMH
[01:56:45] and let's say have a short discussion with with a let's say marginally
[01:56:50] qualified physician about um hormone Is that the sort of thing that is just
[01:56:57] impossible for people to access who don't have insurance? Um, if they do have insurance, does insurance cover it?
[01:57:02] Do they need to do they need to have a major problem to get a referral for that? I have no concept of this because as a as a man, we don't think about
[01:57:09] this, right? Insurance will cover it. The problem is, so there's a lot of issues. One,
[01:57:17] patients don't know that there's something wrong. They think irregular periods are normal. They think painful periods are normal. They think it's just
[01:57:23] their nerves because people around them, including their parents, their aunt, sister, everyone dismisses them. Oh, it
[01:57:29] can't be that bad. Why are you being so weak? Take some Advil and get up. No,
[01:57:34] the this this is really debilitating. This is not premenstrual cramping. This is pain. This is abnormal levels of
[01:57:40] pain. And they don't have anything to check it against because it's in some cases all they ever knew. And it sounds as if people are very
[01:57:46] dismissive of women's pain is what I'm hearing. Period. Yeah. It's minimized, dismissed, or normalized. And there's no other way
[01:57:53] around that. Those are the three options right now in the health care system majority of the time. So then this
[01:57:58] patient goes to the doctor not knowing what's going on. The doctor doesn't have time. You have 10 minutes with your doctor. He comes in, he's like, "Maybe
[01:58:05] she has endometriosis. Maybe he he or she is even thinking about this." But what do they do? They give birth
[01:58:11] control, right? And the patient doesn't know why. She goes home and someone
[01:58:16] tells her, "If you take birth control, you're going to be infertile." So she doesn't take it because her grandmother tells her that and then she continues to
[01:58:23] have pain and starts bouncing from doctor to doctor. A lot of these do patients, believe it or not, end up in GI uh offices getting colonoscopies at a
[01:58:31] young age. Like if you have to do a colonoscopy for pain in a 22year-old, make sure you're you're not missing
[01:58:38] endometriosis. So it's like you have to teach all these doctors. So doctors don't have time. They don't diagnose
[01:58:44] these patients and they start bouncing from doctor to doctor. How can we fix this? And insurance will pay for these
[01:58:52] visits. But you need to be empowered. You need to be educated and you need to
[01:58:58] be your own self health advocate when it comes to endometriosis on top of every
[01:59:03] other diagnosis. Why? If I'm telling you all the symptoms of endometriosis and
[01:59:09] you have them, you already know you have endometriosis. Go on chat GPT. it will confirm it for you.
[01:59:15] So, painful periods, UTI, painful sex with deep penetration, GI pain, GI pain, bloating, chronic pelvic pain,
[01:59:24] leg pain, just pain, pain that con it's comes with your period and eventually
[01:59:31] takes over your life. Now, educate yourself. Write down the questions. I'm
[01:59:36] telling you, a you need if you're young and you want a family, you need your egg count checked. So, write AMH on your
[01:59:42] to-do list before you go to your doctor's office. Two, ask for a pelvic ultrasound. You know, I have a physical
[01:59:48] therapist. He said, "Every time my daughter goes to a doctor, I tell her to exaggerate her symptoms by 50%." So, if
[01:59:55] she has a five out of 10 pain, I say, "Go tell your doctor it's 10 out of 10 so they minimize it to five out of 10."
[02:00:00] So, you can get your pelvic ultrasound. But don't do that. Just ask your doctor. say, "I have pain and you need to give
[02:00:07] me a pelvic ultrasound order and if you don't, I'm going to go do it somewhere else or I'm going to go to another doctor." Most doctors want to help.
[02:00:14] They're not there to hurt you. They're there to help you. Sometimes if they don't think of of it, maybe reminding
[02:00:20] them that this could be an endometriosis is the first step. They're your advocate. They want to help you. So,
[02:00:26] guide them in the right direction. Ask for that pelvic ultrasound. Ask for that egg count. And when it comes to
[02:00:32] endometriosis, a normal ultrasound does not mean you don't have endometriosis. A
[02:00:38] normal pelvic MRI does not mean you don't have endometriosis. Endometriosis
[02:00:43] can be minimal, mild, moderate, or severe. And we stage it 1 2 3 4. The
[02:00:49] higher the stage, the more uh involvement, the more aggressive the endometriosis is. Endometriosis can be
[02:00:57] superficial. These implants can be superficial in the pelvis. They could be in the ovary called endometrioma or they
[02:01:03] can be deep infiltrating where they go deep and as I told you they make their own nerve fibers. And what happens
[02:01:10] eventually these nerve fibers start shooting and our central nervous system
[02:01:15] starts going in overdrive and exaggerating those pains. That's why the
[02:01:21] pain is so real and so debilitating because their body they get sensitization to this new nerve pains
[02:01:29] that are forming in their pelvis. The gold standard way of treating this is a
[02:01:35] laparoscopic resection of endometriosis. Surgery. Surgery. There's no like VEGF inhibitor or
[02:01:43] something of that sort. So let's talk about that. So you don't have to jump to surgery, but surgery is
[02:01:50] the gold standard way of diagnosing a to be 100% if you're not confident and b
[02:01:57] cutting these excising these lesions. We used to burn them, but as of like for the past 15 years, we've learned that
[02:02:03] you really need to cut them. You don't want to burn them, right? Because burning them is just a band-aid and the
[02:02:09] pain comes back. Peripheral nerves grow back very readily once they're there. I mean, this is reassuring to anyone that has a
[02:02:15] peripheral nerve injury, it'll grow back, unlike a brain injury where it's variable outcome. But when peripheral
[02:02:21] nerves want to grow, they grow. They grow. Yeah. They're very stubborn. They're stubborn and they're painful.
[02:02:27] Here's the problem, Andrew. Surgery is not firstline therapy, but it's gold standard. If you have a patient in
[02:02:34] severe pain who's not responding to hormonal suppression, which we we're going to talk about. But here's the
[02:02:39] problem with surgery. Do you know that out of 100 gynecologists,
[02:02:47] one is trained to do laparoscopic endometriosis surgery and then it gets better. If you give 100 laparoscopes
[02:02:55] to 100 gynecologists, half of them will wake the patient up
[02:03:01] and say you didn't have it. Endometriosis, the typical endometriosis implants are
[02:03:08] glandular endometriosis. So when you look at it, they're blood filled, right? There are these black spots, purple
[02:03:15] spots all over the pelvis. But sometimes you really need to look for them. You have to lift the o lift the ovary, look
[02:03:21] underneath, look at the bladder. Like with the laparoscope, you have to go really close to find them. The problem
[02:03:27] is a small subgroup of patients have stromal endometriosis who's actually,
[02:03:32] you know, this stromal endometriosis is not as rare as what you read. It's actually very common in almost every end
[02:03:39] endometriosis surgery that I do. My path report shows at some stroal
[02:03:45] endometriosis implants. So stromal endometriosis, imagine those cells in the uterus, they have the gland, but
[02:03:51] they also have the stroma, the connective tissue around it. Stromal endometriosis doesn't have the glandular
[02:03:58] uh lesions with it. It's just these fibers that have nerve endings and the
[02:04:04] the nerves get squeezed and actually patients with stromal endometriosis tend to have more bloating, more inflammation
[02:04:10] and more deeper pain. But when you put a laposcope, you only see these thin
[02:04:16] lines. Sometimes it takes me 15 minutes to find it. So if I put a camera and I look for
[02:04:23] these purple spots, I'm like, "No, you don't have it." So imagine here you have a patient who's had 15 years of pain,
[02:04:32] ends up in the hospital, goes home, she lost her job, she's on narcotics, she's
[02:04:38] halfway addicted to these medications. She's depressed. She's anxious. And finally the doctor says, "I think you
[02:04:43] have endometriosis. Let's take you to surgery." And then they wake her up and say, "You didn't have it." Oh my goodness.
[02:04:49] But that's what I see. And they missed it. In many cases, they missed it. But you want to vomit.
[02:04:55] You literally I want to pass out sometimes when these patients tell me these stories. I can write a thousand
[02:05:01] stories like this for you. Sounds like the field of which you're trying to fix is badly flawed in some
[02:05:09] sort of like central structural way. It is. It just sort of feels like and and we
[02:05:15] could explore the reasons for that. Um but that comes clear in what you're
[02:05:20] saying. Do we know what causes endometriosis? The first one is this retrograde uh flow of the menstrual uh
[02:05:28] flow. Second is an immune system issue, right? Which I told you for whatever reason the immune system cannot their
[02:05:34] immune system cannot clear out this um these implants which goes to the PCOS,
[02:05:40] right? Remember I told you PCOS patients have so much cytoines released from their viseral. It's my hypothesis
[02:05:48] that that's why I see so much endometriosis with PCOS that this chronic inflammation that is caused in
[02:05:56] PCOS patients is fueling these implants from not being cleared. Right? That's
[02:06:02] why I see so much. That's my hypothesis. Someone needs my problem is I don't have time to do all of this. There's so much
[02:06:08] I want to do. You're too busy saving all these families and women and kids. I would have done so much. I love women.
[02:06:13] I would have done so much for them if I could multiply myself to five more or 10 more. But anyways, so inflammation is
[02:06:20] another theory. Um then it's the uh metiplasia of this malarian duct you
[02:06:26] know the malarian duct that forms the uterus and the fallopian tubes. Maybe embryologically these cells are left
[02:06:33] somewhere in the body. That's why we see implants sometimes by the diaphragm or so you can find it in people's lungs or
[02:06:38] very rarely in their brain. So you can't say that's retrograde menstruation, right?
[02:06:44] The other hypothesis is through blood vessels from the uterus that these cells get picked up in the vessels and implant
[02:06:51] in distant uh organs like the lung or the brain. But was it always this common or you
[02:06:57] It's always been this common. Okay. So it's not as if in the last you know 20 years we're seeing a huge
[02:07:02] increase in I mean it's difficult to say because as you said the diagnosis it the whole system is faulty you know
[02:07:07] but you can't really study. That's why I'm telling you it's not 10%. I get so upset when people say 10%. I'm like it's
[02:07:13] not 10%. Cuz it's, think about it, 15% of women have PCOS, which I think it's
[02:07:18] more. And I think half of those patients have endometriosis. So that's just the
[02:07:23] PCOS group. And then I think in the general population, if I had to guess, I would
[02:07:29] say north of 20% have endometriosis. And I feel like that's a huge number. 20% is an enormous
[02:07:35] number. Enormous. That's why I'm here to tell you this is not some zebra diagnosis.
[02:07:42] This affects every family in every every single person can think of someone in
[02:07:49] their life who either has PCOS, PCOS and endometriosis or endometriosis. There's
[02:07:54] no way if you close your eyes and think that you cannot think of someone like that. There's no such human because
[02:08:00] they're everywhere. There are millions of these women, but they are all dismissed and they are told for years
[02:08:08] and years that they're crazy. And that needs to stop. If I hear one
[02:08:14] more doctor or health care provider or physician assistant or anyone call a
[02:08:20] woman crazy, I want like literally I want to turn this world upside down. Well, it seems
[02:08:26] like a, you know, grounds for malpractice to call a patient crazy, even if they're a psychiatrist calling
[02:08:31] somebody who has a severe mental condition crazy. I think that what what's becoming increasingly clear as we
[02:08:37] have this conversation, is that for these issues surrounding women's
[02:08:43] reproductive health and hormone health generally, because I I realize not everyone wants to have kids. Many many women do, but many women perhaps don't.
[02:08:50] the core component seems to be that there's kind of like a lot of overlap in the ven diagram. And so while I'm I'm
[02:08:57] not trying to get any physician a pass, it seems like the only people who really understand this are the clinicians like
[02:09:04] yourself who spent a lot of time with people with these conditions and the patients themselves. I think that one
[02:09:10] thing that I'm hoping will happen as a consequence of this conversation as well as just the general theme around podcast
[02:09:17] and public health communication is that in general patients are dismissed as
[02:09:23] having important knowledge about their own health. And I I think that you know we we put doctors on a pedestal because
[02:09:30] they are incredible healers potentially incredible healers. No one knows more about their own body than oneself. I
[02:09:37] will make especially women. Especially women. I was going to say yes, absolutely. And and you know, it's going to sound like I'm trying to grab,
[02:09:42] you know, political correctness points now, even though earlier I was saying politically incorrect things um by
[02:09:48] saying this, but I I firmly believe that, you know, and again, I've only lived as a male, so I I only know my own
[02:09:54] my own situation, but by menrating, by having hormone cycles that across the
[02:10:00] month are more extreme typically than male hormone cycles. I think it's fair to say that that women are much more in
[02:10:08] tune with changes in their underlying physiology and how they relate to their underlying psychology and back and
[02:10:14] forth. From a scientific perspective, you'd say, "Oh, they they've experienced more variables and more outcomes.
[02:10:20] They've run more experiments, right? It's being it's happening internally." Again, not to make it reductionist or or
[02:10:25] overly uh you know uh intellectual, but I think that
[02:10:30] the the first thing to do is to really give the statements that patients make
[02:10:36] even if they're not technical, you know, perhaps especially if they're not technical, to give them an an enormous
[02:10:42] amount of merit. Who knows more about their own body than the person experiencing something? And women are in
[02:10:47] a position to know far more about their own changes within their body because they're always undergoing changes across
[02:10:53] the month. Yeah, that's that's coming uh coming through very clearly. And I will tell you, 30 years in women's
[02:11:00] health, 25 years in private practice, when a woman tells you something's wrong,
[02:11:05] 99% of the time something's wrong. Take them seriously. The last thing they are
[02:11:10] is crazy. The last thing they are is stress related or hormone related. It's
[02:11:16] not in their head. I had a patient once who told me every time I go to the doctor, uh, my doctor tells me it's my
[02:11:23] problem is between my ears. Oh goodness. I mean, unless they're a psychiatrist, and even if they're a
[02:11:28] psychiatrist, we now know that metabolic health impacts brain health. Yeah. That that's that's criminal. I mean, honestly, what you're describing is
[02:11:34] criminal. It's it's not It is criminal. That's why I'm here, though. But it is. And it has to change.
[02:11:40] It really Why do you think I want President of the United States to give me that mic? that you did today. I don't
[02:11:46] think you're going to understand the impact of this podcast today. I don't think I mean I'm sure you do cuz you're
[02:11:52] amazing and you have millions of followers. But the information is coming from you. I mean I know but but women's health is very
[02:11:59] different than any other field in the medicine. Let me tell you what my solution is. You know what my solution
[02:12:05] is? You literally need to separate OB obstetrics from gynecology. You need to
[02:12:11] separate it. Tell me more. I think for doctors who want to deliver babies, great. Go learn how to deliver
[02:12:19] babies. Take care of those women like they're your family member. Give them the time. Have the energy. Don't run
[02:12:26] from your office to deliver them last minute. Hold their hand. Don't dismiss them. And just focus on giving them the
[02:12:33] best experience they can possibly have, which women are not getting that right
[02:12:39] now in this healthcare system. and then separate the residency and for
[02:12:46] whoever does not want to deliver babies, teach them gynecology, teach them how to
[02:12:52] recognize PCOS, teach them what endometriosis is, teach them how to do a laparoscopic hysterctomy without cutting
[02:12:58] the patient from their belly button all the way down. Do you know that in Los Angeles there's
[02:13:06] maybe two of us that can do a laparoscopic hysterctomy and take a uterus out this
[02:13:13] big and I think I'm the only one that does it outpatient. That's you laparoscopic for those of you who don't know. So small small incisions. So
[02:13:21] you're not talking about you know major scar incisions, right? So coming in laterally and and essentially doing everything from uh the camera from the
[02:13:28] camera. So literally a uterus the size of a watermelon. I take out laparoscopically
[02:13:34] outpatient. Patient goes home the same day. Amazing. Yeah. But but that should be standard of
[02:13:40] care. So these patients are still getting cut because it's so big from their belly
[02:13:45] button all the way down vertical incision which is traumatic in you know it would be traumatic to me. And these
[02:13:52] patients have six to eight weeks of recovery have to stay in the hospital for 2 three days. I
[02:13:58] lost my outpatient privileges at Cedars because I haven't done surgery at Cedars. I do it in the outpatient
[02:14:04] Cedars. So, it's because you really if you train these doctors uh well, they don't need
[02:14:11] to um take their patients in the hospital and quality of care will go up.
[02:14:17] The problem right now is when you're busy running around delivering babies all night. I used to deliver 80 babies a
[02:14:24] month. 80 babies a month. When I was pregnant with my first daughter, Delara, who you
[02:14:30] met at Stanford, I delivered 82 patients
[02:14:38] when I was 34 weeks pregnant until one night my husband used to drive me to the hospital. I had my pillow and a blanket
[02:14:44] in the car. One time when I was running at 1:00 in the morning, I fell on the
[02:14:49] lawn and my husband was like, "You can't do this anymore." And that's when I started cutting back. But my point is
[02:14:55] take that doctor who's I was up all night. Then I would come to my office
[02:15:01] the next day like nothing happened at night and now I had 30 40 patients on my
[02:15:06] schedule. Gyn patients. How can you catch that endo patient? How can you
[02:15:12] diagnose that PCOS patients? And let me tell you, you can't just diagnose in your head and throw a medication at
[02:15:18] them. Patients compliance goes down when they don't know why they're taking a medic certain medication. But if you
[02:15:24] take the time and explain it to them, they're going to go home and say, "This medication I'm going to take." So if you
[02:15:30] separate OB from gyn, then you empower gynecologists a to
[02:15:36] spend more time with their patients to not be exhausted, not run from the
[02:15:41] hospital into their office just completely burnt out. And then you can
[02:15:46] focus on women's health. And then we can also talk about well woman exam. I mean, I can sit here until tomorrow morning
[02:15:53] and talk to you about what a wellwoman exam should all be about. I love it. Well, we can do multiple
[02:15:58] podcasts, but uh but you're also giving us tools to understand
[02:16:04] uh for women to understand for themselves if they likely have endometriosis.
[02:16:09] Um you know, the painful periods, UTI issues, GI pain, um
[02:16:14] bloating, bloating. You mentioned earlier that with AMH, whatever units it's measured in, 0.1 of the typical units it's
[02:16:21] measured in corresponds to one egg. Typically, um, ultrasound can be
[02:16:27] informative, but often even with high resolution ultrasound, it's not
[02:16:32] exhaustive. You can it can be missed. Laparoscopic surgery in and out the same day, no major scar is the ideal way to
[02:16:40] go. Very, very few doctors are actually doing that. But a number of the things we just listed off are actionable.
[02:16:46] People can think about them at any age. I think that's one of the big themes coming through today among others is
[02:16:52] that if a woman is 19, 22, 42, 14,
[02:16:57] yeah, 14. Okay. As I that if some of these symptoms are occurring, they need to take them seriously. I know we talked
[02:17:03] about surgery when it comes to endometriosis, but endometriosis implants in general, not the stromal
[02:17:10] type. Uh they grow with estrogen, but their growth slows down with progesterone. So if you have a young
[02:17:17] patient who you suspect they might have endometriosis and you can't really prove
[02:17:22] it, right? you don't have the experience, but you know they're complaining of painful periods. And I'm talking to clinicians right now or
[02:17:28] patients, then there's nothing uh wrong with prescribing them some form of birth
[02:17:36] control or hormonal suppression that will suppress their symptoms of endometriosis. What do I mean by that?
[02:17:42] You can use progesterone only birth control pills, which that's what I would remember. We talked about birth control
[02:17:48] and I said I want to circle back with endometriosis. Birth control pills in endometriosis patients can be the
[02:17:55] difference of fertility and not having children. That's how amazing birth
[02:18:00] control pills work for suppression of endometriosis. Would you recommend against estrogen
[02:18:07] birth control pills because these these I want these implants right tissues
[02:18:12] these ectopic tissues meaning sorry ectopic it's the the scientist in me the these tissues that are essentially in
[02:18:18] the wrong place they've migrated their form there they are sensitive to estrogen in the sense that they grow in response to estrogen does that mean that
[02:18:25] in the in the first half of the ovulatory cycle the menstrual cycle that there's more pain at that time
[02:18:32] no they actually have more pain with the shedding of the lining with the period.
[02:18:37] But some patients do complain of chronic pain because remember these implants
[02:18:44] eventually cause scarring cause nerve pain and those nerve pains are start you know they start firing all month and
[02:18:50] that's why chronic pelvic pain now so you want to give it progesterone you can give this progesterone in a form of
[02:18:56] birth control right so if I have a patient who also has PCOS and has acne
[02:19:01] hair loss facial hair body hair irregular periods painful periods and their mood disorder is not that bad. I'm
[02:19:08] like, maybe I give her a slint because I can kill two birds with one stone. I can suppress her PCOS symptoms and I can
[02:19:14] suppress her endometriosis. But most PCOS patients, which is the crowd I see with endometriosis, have mood disorder.
[02:19:20] So, one of the um methods that I use to suppress endometriosis is actually a proesterine IUD like Kylina or Merina
[02:19:29] IUD. Morina IUD is the most common progesterone IUD used in this country.
[02:19:35] um if you use it for you know it's a method of birth control and it can last for eight years sometimes we use it for
[02:19:41] heavy period and you use it for 5 years but I use it very often in my patients
[02:19:47] with endometriosis or adnomiiosis for young girls who haven't had children I
[02:19:54] tend to go with the smaller IUD because Marina IUD is slightly larger than the Kylina IUD so I love the Kylina IUD and
[02:20:02] I'm not advertising for it I'm just saying it because it really works. So for patients who have a lot of mood
[02:20:07] disorders, then I might go to these IUDs which are more local in suppressing the
[02:20:12] endometriosis in the pelvis. So I start with either a progesterone birth control or a progesterone IUD. And by the way, I
[02:20:20] always check egg count. Always, always, because I want to make sure we're not low because if you have low egg count
[02:20:27] and you're 17, you're going to go freeze eggs. I'm not going to wait for you to be older to freeze. Waiting for that
[02:20:34] patient to be 30 or 35, you're done. You know, they will have no eggs left. So,
[02:20:40] suppressed with progesterone birth control, progesterone IUD. Then we have u G&R antagonist. I don't
[02:20:49] know if you've heard of these pills or Alyssa or my famry. These are medications. is remember I told you you
[02:20:55] either um give it progesterone or you take the estrogen away to treat endometriosis. So giving it progesterone
[02:21:01] you can do the progesterone IUD or the progesterone birth control. I don't like the implants because of the weight and irregular bleed that comes with it but
[02:21:09] you can also take the estrogen away. These medications work amazing especially for women who have painful
[02:21:15] sex and usually by 2 months they get a relief from that painful sex and painful
[02:21:20] period. The problem is anytime you take estrogen away, what happens? You can have hot flashes. You can have all the
[02:21:27] symptoms like a pseudo menopause. Correct. These pills are great because they're reverse reversible. So if you
[02:21:33] don't like them, you can take them for a couple of days and stop it and it's out of your system in a couple of days. So it's not a big deal, but it does make a
[02:21:39] difference. The problem with these pills are because of the effect on the bone and the bone loss it causes, you can
[02:21:44] take him up to two years. So you can't take him beyond two years. Usually if I
[02:21:50] do a progesterone suppression and the patient has pain, I recommend surgery because during surgery, I resect the
[02:21:58] endometriosis, I cut all the adhesions if they have it, and then I put a progesterone IUD and I
[02:22:05] send them home. For patients during surgery who have severe disease, stage
[02:22:10] three or four, then I also add these G&RH antagonists after surgery depending
[02:22:16] on their stage or symptoms from 6 months up to two years to suppress estrogen
[02:22:22] suppress it and to just kill the endometriosis because when it's advanced stage, even with surgery and IUD, let's
[02:22:29] say stage four, it can come right back. So, I really want to knock it out. So that's what I would um I would do for
[02:22:36] endometriosis patients and very important point the stage of
[02:22:41] endometriosis has nothing to do with the degree of pain and this is very important for
[02:22:48] patients to understand. You can have stage one endometriosis and you end up in the emergency room every month
[02:22:54] because of pain or you can have stage four endometriosis and you just have mild pain. So pain you can't say oh
[02:23:02] you're there's not much in your pelvis I'm not going to worry about it. So that's one. The other thing is remember
[02:23:08] I told you stromal endometriosis that doesn't have the glandular aspect of the
[02:23:13] tissue is missing. The glad glandular aspect is mostly the fibrous part of it.
[02:23:19] These lesions are almost always missed on laparoscopy. they tend to cause more
[02:23:25] inflammation and they they tend to be more resistant to progesterone in my opinion.
[02:23:31] So those are the ones that you really need to cut out. But then if you've never seen stomal endometriosis, you
[02:23:37] will not remove it during surgery and you will wake your patient up and say you didn't have it.
[02:23:43] So stage does not equate to pain and vice and vice versa. Absolutely. These days it seems at least
[02:23:49] in the United States that women are opting to have children later or not at all. We know that having children before
[02:23:57] age 40 is protective against certain cancers and he breast cancer in particular and if and if women have uh
[02:24:04] the BA mutations then that number goes way way up. So um
[02:24:10] is there any indication that pregnancy at before a given age, successful
[02:24:16] pregnancy or maybe just pregnancy in general before a given age is protective against PCOS and endometriosis?
[02:24:23] For endometriosis, yes, because during pregnancy your endometriosis is at bay.
[02:24:28] Patients have no pain, right? It all starts when the menstrual cycle starts again. But what I do for these patients,
[02:24:34] as soon as they deliver, I put a progesterone IUD in them. when they come postpartum, six weeks postpartum, and
[02:24:40] they're discussing birth control, I always recommend a progesterone birth control. Do you think that um well, these days we
[02:24:47] hear a lot more about postpartum depression? Yes. Um and I'm very intrigued by this. Yes. Like any medical discussion, when
[02:24:54] you hear about something more often, you get two very polarized arguments. One is it's been limited diagnosis, and this
[02:25:00] has been around a long time, and people have just been suffering in silence. You hear this about psychiatric conditions,
[02:25:06] childhood neurologic conditions. You hear about this about gut issues. And then on the other end of the spectrum,
[02:25:12] you often will hear, well, people are just sort of like they're just kind of fanatic about these terms and then now
[02:25:18] people are paying attention for to it. Um, do you think that postpartum depression is on the rise and does it
[02:25:24] have any correlation with things like endometriosis? Postpartum depression I think in is we
[02:25:31] see more in patients with anxiety, trauma or PTSD. So to answer your question uh endometriosis and PCOS
[02:25:39] patients have anxiety, have depression and have PTSD. When you live their
[02:25:45] experience in their life and everything they've gone through in their life, they all have PTSD. So anyone with any
[02:25:52] history of anxiety, PTSD or depression or PMDD, a severe form of PMS,
[02:25:59] all of these patients are at a higher risk of postpartum depression. And to answer your question, because anxiety is
[02:26:06] on the rise, because depression is on the rise, um postpartum depression is
[02:26:11] very common. It is very difficult honestly to navigate the different
[02:26:18] stages of life being a woman. You know, imagine when you're young, some of them
[02:26:24] with endometriosis and PCOS, they have all that struggle. Then they try to get
[02:26:29] pregnant. They don't get pregnant. They need to sell everything they have to pay for an IVF to have a baby. Then they
[02:26:34] have a baby. They their body changes. There's this giant drop in estrogen that
[02:26:41] puts them into this, you know, postpartum blues and then postpartum
[02:26:46] depression. And that goes dismissed by family members, by everyone. Oh, you're
[02:26:52] not sleeping well probably. Oh, it's normal. It's because you haven't had a child. No. These patients, even with
[02:26:57] PMDDD, they completely dissociate themselves from their environment, from their child. It's it's really
[02:27:04] heartbreaking. And then once they're done with all this in their early 40s,
[02:27:10] per menopause comes, late 30s, early 40s, right? It's like wave after wave,
[02:27:15] wave after wave, and then pmenopause, which is again not diagnosed, right? Average age of menopause is 51 and a
[02:27:21] half, 45 to 55 is the range. Seven to 10 years before menopause, women go through
[02:27:26] perry menopause. And during that pmenopausal time, their mood can go.
[02:27:31] They're not sleeping well. They have hot flashes, night sweats, irregular periods, they're gaining weight, their
[02:27:37] uh sex hurts, their joint, they have frozen shoulder, they start having hair
[02:27:42] loss, they have skin thinning. And all these things are happening and no one's diagnosing them. No one's treating them
[02:27:47] with hormone replacement until they go through menopause. And then that's
[02:27:53] another chapter of life that just turns your body and your life upside down. And
[02:27:58] most men don't even know what menopause is. So imagine just the story of this
[02:28:05] one woman through her life. And then look how many times there are opportunities for this patient to get
[02:28:11] dismissed in the health care system. That's why I have a broken heart. And you're also doing a ton of healing
[02:28:18] for people. But I hear you loud and clear. what you describe would uh cause most men,
[02:28:23] including me, to dissolve into a puddle of her own tears is my only response. Fibroids,
[02:28:29] there's hope, though. I don't want to be all negative. No, that's why we're here. We're here. I feel like I'm ne I it might come out
[02:28:35] negative because that's what I see. Do you know what I'm saying? I see I say my office, my waiting room is the waiting
[02:28:41] room of dismissed women in this country. So maybe so I have a skewed view, but
[02:28:48] it's so real and it's so painful to watch that, you know, that's why I sound
[02:28:56] a little negative, but I'm not a negative person. I don't I don't think you sound negative if I'm honest. I think you sound very
[02:29:01] passionate about um your empathy for the pain that you observe. And it must be in
[02:29:07] I'm realizing right now it must be incredibly frustrating to know that
[02:29:13] there are solutions and to see so many people suffer. Yes. Like I can think of almost nothing worse
[02:29:21] than having the solution to somebody's suffering and not being they don't know
[02:29:28] and because they don't know they they can't access that solution. Um, and as you mentioned, it's a very
[02:29:34] tangled web of of medical infrastructure and things like that, but uh, what comes through is your your your passion and
[02:29:40] your care for people, for women, for women. For women. Yes. Specifically women. And also your
[02:29:47] desire to give them useful information that they can act on and and u better their lives and their health.
[02:29:54] Fibroids. I hear about fibroids. Where does that fit into this picture if at all or is that completely separate? Fibroids are very common.
[02:30:01] Mhm. By age 50, 80% of women have some form of fibroids. Like if you stand at the
[02:30:08] side of the street and pull out 100 women, you know, a lot of them will have fibroids. When it comes to fibroids, the
[02:30:15] location of the fibroid is very important. You can have a small fibroid in the lining of that cavity that we
[02:30:21] talked about that can cause you to have heavy periods, blood clots, you become
[02:30:27] anemic, um fertility issues, all of that. Or you can have a 10 cm fibroid
[02:30:32] outside of the uterus that can make you look like you're pregnant, but it doesn't do anything to your bleeding.
[02:30:39] So, when it comes to fibroids, the location of it is very important. For patients who have small fibroids, it's
[02:30:45] away from the cavity. they don't have any symptoms. We just watch them. Uh, as they grow, you're more likely, you know,
[02:30:52] women in their 40s are very likely to have fibroids or develop fibroids. But if it doesn't bother them, we don't do
[02:30:58] anything. We operate on fibroids for several reasons. Number one, if it's inside the cavity and it causes causes
[02:31:03] anemia, infertility or heavy periods. We operate on fibroids if they're extremely
[02:31:09] large and they cause bloating after like you know we go by weeks of pregnancy and
[02:31:14] uh let's say you have a 16 week size fibroid uterus which is equal to a 16 week size uterus pregnant uterus. It
[02:31:22] starts putting pressure on the urers that drain your kidneys. So then you have to talk about either a myomectomy
[02:31:28] for women who want to get pregnant when you go in and you remove the fibroids or hysterctomy for women who are done
[02:31:34] having children. So fibroids are extremely common but then again if you
[02:31:39] don't do a pelvic ultrasound just doing a bmanual exam will never tell you that
[02:31:44] the if these patients have fibroids. Can a woman insist that she get a an ultrasound? Can you walk in and just say
[02:31:51] uh maybe not have to exacerbate the pain from a five to a 10, unless she's already at a 10, of course, but can she
[02:31:58] come in and just say, "Listen, I absolutely want ultrasound. I want you to look at fibroids. I also want you to
[02:32:03] do everything you can to determine if I have endometriosis. Here's what endometriosis there is. I heard uh a
[02:32:10] podcast where an exp a true expert in this describe these things." How how do you think a physician would respond to
[02:32:15] that? Um I like to think that they would say, "Wow, this person knows a lot. I better do everything. There you go. Bravo. Empowered, right?
[02:32:24] That's why I called my um podcast she MD. Strong, healthy, empowered. If you
[02:32:30] empower the woman to be her own health advocate and she has that list and she takes that to her doctor's office, nine
[02:32:38] out of 10, like I said, doctors are amazing humans. They they're there to help you. But if that doctor doesn't
[02:32:44] have a pelvic ultrasound in his office, which is probably very common, then ask them for an order to go to a radiology
[02:32:51] center to the hospital near you. But you should, every woman should have a pelvic
[02:32:56] ultrasound. I think it should be part of wellw women exam every single year. Yeah. Why isn't it just part of the
[02:33:02] standard exam? It should be every male that goes in for a general exam has his uh testicles grabbed and
[02:33:08] told to cough over the sink looking for a hernia. So it could be the the equivalent of of that. Well, I mean,
[02:33:14] they just do it. They do it no matter what. It takes me less than a minute to do a
[02:33:19] pelvic ultrasound, but then I've done it for 30 years. But this is not an hourong procedure.
[02:33:26] And you know what? Let me tell you, I had a patient with a uterine septum. Do
[02:33:31] you know what that is? when the uterine cavity is actually divided in two because of this septum that was supposed
[02:33:38] to be absorbed, you know, but it never did. Unless you do a pelvic ultrasound
[02:33:44] and unless you're a good ultrasographer, you will miss this septum. And these are
[02:33:49] patients who have recurrent miscarriages. They don't get pregnant. They sometimes
[02:33:54] come from fertility clinics and they're like, "My doctor said I fall into the unexplained category. There's nothing
[02:34:02] unexplained. So if you want to assess your fertility, I have buckets of it. One, female
[02:34:09] factor. What is female factor? Check your hormones. Make sure your egg count is normal, right? Make sure your
[02:34:14] prolactin, thyroid, everything's normal. Do an STD check, gorrhea, chlamydia, all
[02:34:19] of that. Next bucket, male factor. What's the sperm like? Is your partner
[02:34:25] smoking weed every single day? Um, has he had radiation because of testicular
[02:34:31] cancer? Whatever. Has he had fertility issues with his previous partner? Make sure the semen analysis is normal. It
[02:34:37] takes one minute to check that. The third bucket is uh tubal factor or
[02:34:44] anatomy. Is the anatomy normal? Do we have fibroids in the uterus? Is there a
[02:34:49] septum? Are the tubes open? Have you had chlamydia? Do you have, you know, any
[02:34:54] kind of adhesions? But you know that's the next bucket. The fourth bucket is
[02:35:00] endometriosis. Are you missing endometriosis? Do you have painful periods, painful sex,
[02:35:05] bloating, everything we talked about? Rule that out. The next bucket, PCOS. Do
[02:35:11] you have irregular periods? Do you have PCOS looking ovaries on ultrasound? Do you have symptoms of high testosterone?
[02:35:17] If you do, you're 70 80% chance you're not even ovulating. Boom. That's your
[02:35:22] problem, right? If you have PCOS then you have in my opinion that's aliabody
[02:35:27] diagnosis you have a 50% chance of having endometriosis then go back to the other bucket and make sure you're not
[02:35:33] missing endometriosis and the last one is autoimmune for me which is very
[02:35:39] important these are patients who can't get pregnant or when they get pregnant they lose the pregnancy
[02:35:45] especially my endometriosis patients endometriosis is a form of autoimmune and I always say if you have one
[02:35:50] autoimmune condition you probably have a 30% chance of having some other autoimmune condition. Run this
[02:35:56] autoimmune bucket because if someone has let's say antifhospholippid syndrome and
[02:36:03] they're hypercoagulable and pregnancy make you more hypercoagulable you can actually make blood clots in the
[02:36:11] placenta and these are patients who keep having miscarriages and they don't know why. What about other autoimmune
[02:36:17] conditions like uh psoriasis, not even mild psoriasis, it's suggestive of
[02:36:23] overactive interlucans and things of that sort. Any autoimmune I do a full autoimmune
[02:36:28] panel. And for patients who I go through all these buckets. So these buckets I told you your your listeners can do it
[02:36:35] at home. You don't need your doctors because some doctors don't know what these buckets are and they're not really
[02:36:42] putting a check mark in front of it. You can do it yourself. You can ask for the first one, first bucket, female factor.
[02:36:48] Ask for your hormones, ask for a semen analysis, second one. For the third one, ask for a pelvic ultrasound. Make sure
[02:36:53] there's no septum in that uterus. Make sure there are no fibroids. Make sure there are no ovarian cysts or anything
[02:36:58] that would cause any problems. For the fourth bucket, ask for testosterone levels. Rule out to see if you have
[02:37:04] PCOS. The next one, endometriosis. Make sure you I taught you today what to do
[02:37:09] to make sure you don't have endometriosis. And if you have any family history of any autoimmune condition, if you have psoriasis, if you
[02:37:16] have shoggrans, if your mom has lupus, if you had recurrent uh pregnancy losses, if you have endometriosis, which
[02:37:22] is autoimmune, ask for a full autoimmune panel because for patients who have autoimmune panel, you can give them
[02:37:29] blood thinners like Lovenox in pregnancy and it'll help uh bring that flow. And
[02:37:35] it's I mean, you know, I have patients who come in, I haven't even gone into the room, and my medical assistant says,
[02:37:41] "Oh, this patient has had five miscarriages, but there's nothing wrong with her." I'm like, "There's no way
[02:37:46] this woman doesn't have an autoimmune condition." But that's pregnancy.
[02:37:52] But can I say something, please? I want to talk about breast cancer. Can I?
[02:37:58] Absolutely. You know, my passions in life are PCOS, endometriosis,
[02:38:03] and the breast cancer calculator. Do you know what that is? Do you know Tyra Cusk? Have you ever had an episode on it?
[02:38:08] No. You're going to love this. So, I always say for women listening to this podcast,
[02:38:16] if you know your first name, your last name, and your date of birth, you need to know your lifetime risk of breast
[02:38:22] cancer. It's mandatory. Lifetime risk of breast cancer. Yes. Have you heard of that? I've heard that term. Good. So, why is
[02:38:29] it so important? I'm sure you've you know of someone in their 30s who end up
[02:38:35] with stage four breast cancer or advanced stage breast cancer and they die way before they get to their
[02:38:40] mamogram age, right? So, the first message I want to say on this podcast is
[02:38:46] that the message of mamograms should start at 40 is misleading and it needs
[02:38:53] to stop. Mamograms start at 40 for very low-risk
[02:38:59] patients. An average American has a 12.5%
[02:39:05] chance of getting breast cancer. 12.5%. Average American for women specifically.
[02:39:11] Yes. So pick your finger, go to a party in a room with 100 women, 12.5 of them,
[02:39:19] just average will get breast cancer. If I That's incredible, right? That's a
[02:39:24] huge number. Now the problem is if you have family
[02:39:30] history of breast cancer or if you have a biopsy that shows atypia at some point
[02:39:35] in your life that will significantly increase your lifetime risk of breast cancer. Why is that important? Again
[02:39:43] there are three buckets for breast cancer risk. Low risk is less than 15%.
[02:39:49] Intermediate risk is 15 to 20%. And high risk is 20% or more. Why am I bringing
[02:39:57] this up? If your lifetime risk of breast cancer is 20% or more, you can start
[02:40:03] breast imaging at 30, not 40. How about that? What does a doctor need to hear um in
[02:40:12] order to put someone in that category? It's a very simple formula. Patients can
[02:40:17] do it at home. See, you don't need your doctor to do this for you. Empowered. That's why women can do this at home.
[02:40:23] It's a formula called tireus risk assessment tool. I have it on GMD.
[02:40:29] It's free. You can literally go on there and calculate your lifetime risk of breast cancer. It asks you for your age,
[02:40:36] height, weight, density of the breast, which you can only get the density of the breast from your breast imaging
[02:40:42] mamogram or your MRI. Usually the radiologists make a comment of whether
[02:40:47] or not you have uh you know fibro glandular fatty breast uh
[02:40:54] heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breast. The higher the density the
[02:40:59] higher your lifetime risk of breast cancer. Patients who have children after age 30
[02:41:06] are at a higher risk. Women who haven't had children. Women with family history. Women with
[02:41:12] genetic mutations. So you answer these questions and at the end of it it will
[02:41:18] calculate your risk of breast cancer over the next 10 years or over your lifetime. If that
[02:41:25] number is 20% or more, you can go to your doctor's office for your wellwoman
[02:41:31] exam after you ask for your egg count and your pelvic ultrasound. You ask them for breast imaging. Especially if you
[02:41:38] have a firstderee relative, mom, sister, daughter with breast cancer, that
[02:41:45] significantly increases your risk. If that risk is north of 20%, you need to
[02:41:50] ask your doctor for breast imaging as early as 30. That's why I had a girl in my um on my podcast at 34. She has stage
[02:41:59] 4 breast cancer. Had she been treated and diagnosed and
[02:42:04] and I'll tell you her story. It's it's really devastating. So, it's important to know your
[02:42:10] left-term risk of breast cancer. Patients who fall into the high-risisk category, 20% or more, in addition to
[02:42:16] mamogram, if they have dense breast tissue, they need to ask for ultrasound of the breast. And for high-risk
[02:42:23] patients, 20% or more, in addition to mamogram and ultrasound, they need to ask for a breast MRI. Now, if your
[02:42:30] doctor writes for a breast MRI, it's probably not going to get covered by insurance. But if your doctor writes
[02:42:37] patient is high risk, lifetime risk is 28%. Then your insurance company has to
[02:42:44] cover, right? So that's how they test doctors. They want to see that lifetime
[02:42:49] risk on the prescription order in order to approve it, but they can still not approve it, but that's another
[02:42:55] discussion. So it's important to know your lifetime risk of breast cancer. For any woman with family history of breast
[02:43:02] cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and the list
[02:43:07] goes on and on, they can ask their doctor to see if they qualify for genetic cancer testing. The company I
[02:43:14] use in my office, I've used for I don't know over 10 years, is Marriott. And um
[02:43:20] the reason I use this specific company, there are a lot of companies that check for genetic cancer testing, right? They
[02:43:26] check 80 90 genes. I think Marriott only checks 63 genes which is fine.
[02:43:33] But so not only Marriott checks you for the cancer-causing genes, they also
[02:43:39] calculate your tire cus for you so the doctor can see it. But in addition to
[02:43:44] that, Marriott takes your tire and also looks in the DNA for tiny little
[02:43:50] markers. These are not main genetic mutations. They're tiny little markers that individually don't have that much
[02:43:56] power, but some women walk around with tons of these uh markers and they add
[02:44:03] the tire with these markers and they give you a risk score. Sometimes I have
[02:44:08] a patient whose tire is 19% but when you calculate uh their risk score it jumps
[02:44:14] up to 34%. So for patients who fall into the very
[02:44:19] high risk category north of north of 35% those patients have the choice of um
[02:44:26] either doing imaging every 6 months alternating mamogram ultrasound with MRI
[02:44:31] or asking their doctor for a medication called temoxifen estrogen receptor blocker
[02:44:37] that reduces the risk of breast cancer by 50% in the next 10 years of their
[02:44:43] life or ask for a double mastctomy which is exactly What I did, and I'm just
[02:44:49] going to end it by this. I have I was 48. I had no family history of breast
[02:44:54] cancer. 85% of women who get breast cancer don't have it in their family. Less than 5% have a genetic mutation.
[02:45:01] Most Americans who get it are just like me. I had no family history. I had no genetic mutation. I was never on
[02:45:07] hormones. I was never overweight. I never smoked. I never I don't drink. I've never done drugs in my life. Um, so
[02:45:15] I was the perfect example of someone did everything. I did everything right. At 48, I had a breast biopsy that showed
[02:45:22] atypia and I asked my uh, obviously I had to go in and do an excisional biopsy. They removed it
[02:45:28] and my doctor said, "Everything's good. Go come back in 6 months." I went to my office and I calculated my lifetime risk
[02:45:34] of breast cancer. And it was the first time I did that because I had no reason to do it before cuz I had no risk
[02:45:39] factors. But when I calculated my lifetime risk, it showed 37%. So I called my doctor and I said, "You tell
[02:45:46] me I'm okay, but this lifetime risk says 37%." And back then I had three daughter, my three daughters. I had not
[02:45:52] adopted my little one. If you told me this plane had a 37% chance of crashing,
[02:45:57] I would never board that plane. I'm very conservative. Please take my breasts off
[02:46:02] and put implants in. I already had implants. I had augmentation. They called me crazy, paranoid. um uh
[02:46:10] anxious. Uh they told me uh I was told that because I didn't have family history or because I looked the way I
[02:46:16] did and I was so healthy that I was very low risk. Yet my number was 37%. Until I
[02:46:22] found the surgeon who was willing to do it. She did it and the day before surgery she was very annoyed with with
[02:46:28] me and she said, "Why are you doing it?" I'm like, "Well, I don't want it." I said the, you know, boarding the plane. Is that what you want your surgeon to
[02:46:33] say to you the day before surgery? She was because she really didn't want to do it. She She really thought I was crazy.
[02:46:39] And I said, uh, why why is it so why do I fight? Why do I have to fight so hard
[02:46:44] to remove my breast? This is my body and I don't care about my breast. It's just it's very personal, but for me it really
[02:46:50] didn't matter. You know what she told me? We have really good chemo for breast
[02:46:56] cancer. Oh my goodness. I'm a women's health advocate. Do you understand? This is how I'm being
[02:47:01] treated in the health care system. Right? So she did it. They gained her
[02:47:07] advice and a week later I get a call that they found breast cancer in my tissue. That's how I diagnosed my breast
[02:47:14] cancer. So all this time they were digging in the left. My breast cancer was sitting on my right breast at 6:00.
[02:47:22] Why am I saying this? I'm not saying this to scare people, but I'm saying this that as a woman's health advocate,
[02:47:27] as a gynecologist, as someone who's I feel like I'm extremely competent in my field. If I had to fight so hard for
[02:47:35] someone to take me seriously, do you think other women have a chance?
[02:47:40] That's why they show up so late. That's why their genetic test is not done. That's why if you don't know your
[02:47:45] lifetime risk of if I didn't know my lifetime risk of breast cancer, I would have never known to ask for these
[02:47:52] options. That's why you have to empower women to be their own health advocate. Go
[02:47:58] calculate your lifetime risk of breast cancer. That's non-negotiable. And if
[02:48:03] that number is 20% or above, ask your doctor for breast imaging. I don't care if you're 34 years old. You need it. And
[02:48:10] if you have family history, ask your doctor for genetic cancer testing. That's not optional. And if you do this,
[02:48:18] that's why, you know what, Andrew, I don't want to jinx myself. I've practiced for 25 years. I've never lost
[02:48:23] a patient under my care to cancer. That's a wonderful thing to be able to say, right?
[02:48:29] But it's not because I do some magic in my office. I'm hyper vigilant with these
[02:48:34] patients. When you come for your wellwoman exam to my office, I'm assessing your fertility. I'm ruling out
[02:48:41] endo. I'm ruling out PCOS. I'm checking your egg count. I'm doing a pelvic ultrasound looking for cyst, fibroid,
[02:48:46] septum. If you have PCOS, if you're young, I'm checking your APO. I'm checking your
[02:48:52] lipoprotein little A status. If you're pmenopausal, I'm checking your ApoE4 to see if that increases your risk of
[02:48:58] dementia. I talk about hormone replacement early uh during pmenopause. I talk about bone density. I talk about
[02:49:04] colonoscopy. I talk about genetic testing. Depending on your lifetime risk of breast cancer, I order different
[02:49:10] things, different imaging for different patients. I check your hormones. I check your thyroid. I check your prolactin.
[02:49:16] So, I talk about anxiety, depression. I talk about eating disorder. So, right
[02:49:22] now, a wellwoman exam for a patient is go to the doctor's office, get your
[02:49:28] papsmear, get an STD check if you're asking for it, right? Ask for birth control, do a
[02:49:35] breast exam. If you're 40, you get an order for mamogram, and then you go home. That's not a
[02:49:40] wellwoman exam. That has to stop. And pelvic ultrasound should be on top of the list.
[02:49:46] I greatly appreciate you telling us this. I I do believe that what you're
[02:49:53] saying will lead to change. It's going to take some time, but I'm going to
[02:49:58] encourage all the women listening to not just do what you suggest, but to also
[02:50:04] echo what you're saying to all of their friends and to all of their family
[02:50:10] members, uh, the women they know, because I do think that that's the way things change, frankly. Um, you know, I
[02:50:18] I've never beat the drum of one particular um health ailment or health
[02:50:23] practice, although morning sunlight. I what I do is I give people information and I try and distribute it so people can distribute it to one another. But um
[02:50:31] if ever there was a a batch of information to come through on this podcast where it was absolutely critical
[02:50:38] that people do what the guest is talking about and share that information and just keep pushing and pushing forward
[02:50:45] with this. Um, it's the information you've been sharing. So, um, and I can't
[02:50:50] say that enough times or emphatically enough. I do have a couple more questions, even
[02:50:56] though you've been incredibly generous with your time. No, of course, but there are questions that come from the the
[02:51:02] audience on social media that I've solicited for prior to the podcast. So, I'm going to just take a moment, grab my phone, which I keep out of the room for
[02:51:08] our discussions, but I'm going to grab it now and see if any of the questions um touch on things that we haven't talked about uh this far. Okay. Okay,
[02:51:15] some excellent questions from the general public.
[02:51:20] This first one is, are there any non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of endometriosis like tests within the
[02:51:27] men from the menstrual blood itself? They're doing a lot of research right now. We don't currently have it right
[02:51:34] now. Non-invasive is well, listen to your patient. That's like 99% accurate.
[02:51:40] Do a pelvic ultrasound. Unfortunately, if you see it on pelvic ultrasound, it's already advanced disease. Or do a pelvic
[02:51:46] MRI because MRI can actually with a experienced radiologist, they can look at these specially infiltrating lesions,
[02:51:54] they can see those on MRI. Is endometriosis an autoimmune disease?
[02:51:59] Yes, it is. We talked about this. Absolutely. And that's why if you have endometriosis and you're trying to get
[02:52:04] pregnant or if you've had a miscarriage, ask your doctor for a full autoimmune panel because when you have one
[02:52:10] autoimmune, you have a 30% chance of having another autoimmune disorder. Is cognitive impairment in menopause
[02:52:17] an absolute occurrence. Like does it necessarily happen as what they want to not always but it's extremely common. I
[02:52:23] call it brain fog. You know, women lose their uh concentration. They don't remember
[02:52:29] things. you go into a room, you're like, why did I come in here? And a lot of that is because of the fluctuations in the hormones and uh the drop in the
[02:52:36] estrogen. So by replacing um by hor giving these patients hormone replacement, they feel like oh my god,
[02:52:43] I'm alive again. I can see again, I can think again. So it absolutely happens. It you know most symptoms of menopause,
[02:52:49] different women experience menopause differently. They all don't share the same exact symptoms, but a lot of women
[02:52:56] complain of brain fog. Is inositol useful for PCOS?
[02:53:02] Yes, absolutely. Gonna have it in OV. What do you think is the most overlooked
[02:53:08] missed cause of infertility by doctors? Everything we talked about endo and PCOS
[02:53:15] hands down a lot of these patients who are unexplained
[02:53:20] are undiagnosed PCOS and endometriosis patients. suggestions for PMDD relief
[02:53:29] for somebody in their 40s. And could you explain PMDD? I don't think we've defined that acronym. PMDD is a severe form of PMS. Very, very
[02:53:37] common. Devastating for these girls. The best way to describe it is these girls,
[02:53:43] two weeks out of the month, they're perfect. Two weeks out of the month, they destroy all their relationships.
[02:53:49] They're depressed. They're crying. They're unmotivated. They don't want to go to school. they completely decline. They don't want to go out
[02:53:56] and two weeks after, so I always say two weeks out of the month, you destroy all all your relationships and then you
[02:54:03] spend two more weeks fixing it. And then the vicious cycle happens over and over again. So PMDD is a severe form of PMS.
[02:54:12] And what happens, it's not an abnormal hormonal u condition. It's actually the brain's
[02:54:19] reaction, extreme reaction to normal hormonal changes in the body. So PMDD,
[02:54:25] the symptoms usually start 10 days before the period and goes away 2 3 days after the period. And this vicious cycle
[02:54:32] happens. Believe it or not, suicide is really high in these patients during those weeks. I'm actually seeing a
[02:54:39] patient from out of state on Friday after my surgery because her family's flying her because she's not feeling
[02:54:45] well and her diagnosis is PMDD. How do you treat it? If you want to use birth control, there's one form of birth
[02:54:51] control. Yas, I don't usually go to it. It helps with the symptoms of PMDD, but
[02:54:56] these patients actually they do really well if you put them on uh SSRIs or
[02:55:02] anti-depressants just 10 days during the month. For these patients, you can prescribe 20 milligrams of Prozac 10 to
[02:55:10] 14 days before their period. So, they only take it 10 to 14 days per month
[02:55:15] after ovulation. They start taking it once a day and they stop at the onset of their period. You can also treat them
[02:55:21] with 25 milligrams of Zoloft. For some reason, their brain responds really well
[02:55:26] to this pulsatile treatment and it's a gamecher for these patients. PMDDD
[02:55:33] patients, you do want to make sure they don't have a chronic underlying anxiety depressive disorder. So, I always refer
[02:55:39] them to uh a psychiatrist, but you can absolutely treat it. For pmenopausal
[02:55:44] women, you can also treat them with hormone replacement. So, someone in her 40s, I want to make sure if she didn't
[02:55:51] have it and suddenly she has, it's not like she hasn't had PMDDD and suddenly she has PMDDD, it's probably it could be
[02:55:58] pmenopause. So, you don't want to miss that. Great. It's the first time I've heard
[02:56:03] such a thorough description of what PMDDD is and what one can do about it.
[02:56:09] Uh I think you just helped a ton of people. Uh a lot of questions about
[02:56:14] fasting and about low starch aka low carbohydrate diet. I 100% say yes. A lot of us are eating,
[02:56:22] you know, like if you're waking uh in the morning and having bread and pasta for lunch and then you're having ice
[02:56:29] cream and then you have uh rice and I don't know, pizza for dinner. Of course,
[02:56:35] it'll start that process. Diet is extremely important. One thing I try to stay away from is limiting these
[02:56:41] patients or telling a 22year-old you are not to have any carbohydrates. That's
[02:56:46] not sustainable. What I believe is if you fix their underlying condition and
[02:56:52] address their insulin resistance and help them exercise and um have healthy
[02:56:57] habits, you can fix these symptoms. Just cutting carbohydrates out. A lot of these PCOS patients are already doing
[02:57:04] this. They're literally starving themselves and they're exercising and they're not losing weight. It's because
[02:57:10] their underlying condition has not been addressed. So I I would say like anything else at moderation. But you
[02:57:16] don't want to tell someone don't eat carbohydrates. It's not sustainable. Someone said that their estradiol patch
[02:57:23] is causing some hair loss. Is there another option? I don't think it's the estradiol patch
[02:57:28] causing the hair loss. Women who use estradiol patches um are going through
[02:57:34] pmenopause and menopause. One of the issues with pmenopause and menopause is that drop in estrogen does cause hair
[02:57:41] thinning. So for that reason I would say you know I usually treat these patients
[02:57:46] with minoxidil. You can either do like ro gain on your scalp or you can take oral minoxidil. Uh the prescription is
[02:57:54] 2.5. You can start as uh little as.5 every single day. The problem is hair
[02:57:59] thinning is very common in menopause and you want to hit it quick. So if you start noticing that you're losing hair.
[02:58:05] Take the minoxidil. It doesn't work overnight. You will probably start seeing results in about six months, but
[02:58:11] in two years it you'll see a huge difference in your hair. But hit it early. And it's not the estrogen patch.
[02:58:16] I doubt it. A number of questions about how to improve quality of eggs after age 35
[02:58:24] presumably by doing all the things that we talked about for the past. lower end intramaler fat, lower inflammation, um
[02:58:31] improve insulin sensitivity, uh suppress endometriosis for sure because endometriosis will go after
[02:58:37] those egg count and quality. PCOS will go after your quality.
[02:58:43] Does endometriosis pain start to wayne with pmenopause? Yes, it gets better. The problem is
[02:58:49] women in their 40s have a lot of adenomiiosis which mimics the symptoms of endometriosis. So these women
[02:58:55] actually do extremely well with the progesterone IUD. We talked about the Marina IUD because it suppresses their
[02:59:01] pelvis and their endometriosis. And once they go through menopause, this is a very important point and I'm so glad you
[02:59:07] brought it up because doctors don't realize this for patients with endometriosis.
[02:59:13] Menopause will make the pain go away, right? Because what happens in menopause are ovaries are not functioning and the
[02:59:22] estrogen levels drop. However, you come and give these women estrogen, what
[02:59:27] happens? You can stimulate these endometriosis implants all over again. And this is what happens. So,
[02:59:33] endometriosis patients in general have a slightly higher increased risk of ovarian cancer, especially the ones with
[02:59:40] endometrias or advanced disease. And post-menopause hormone replacement,
[02:59:45] the estrogen, can still stimulate these implants. Now a lot of women in the health care system who have undergo a
[02:59:52] hyerectomy meaning they remove their uterus the doctor says you don't need progesterone cuz you know we think we
[02:59:58] give the progesterone to protect the lining of the uterus from unopposed estrogen causing uterine cancer. Well
[03:00:05] that's not true. In patients with endometriosis, even when they undergo a hyerectomy and
[03:00:12] they're using estrogen patches, you always want to give them the progesterone because otherwise you
[03:00:18] stimulate this these implants again because of unopposed estrogen. That's
[03:00:24] one reason. And also we use the progesterone micronized progesterone in hormone replacement for patients who are
[03:00:29] anxious, who are not sleeping well, regardless of whether or not they have uter they have a uterus. But
[03:00:35] endometriosis patients their hormone replacement should always be with progesterone. Are there any natural ways to increase
[03:00:41] progesterone? So one reason uh our body doesn't uh you know when we don't ovulate we don't make
[03:00:48] that corpus ludial cyst and we don't have that progesterone being secreted. So in PCOS let's say by lowering your
[03:00:56] weight by lowering that visceral fat but reg by regulating your insulin resistance you can increase your chance
[03:01:03] of ovulation and by ovulation then you start releasing the progesterone. So that's the best way of describing it but
[03:01:10] for pmenopausal women then you need to um prescribe them the micronized
[03:01:15] progesterone. You already answered this earlier but I think it's worth just briefly repeating.
[03:01:21] uh how does diet affect female hormone health? As we get closer to menopause, we become more insulin resistant regardless of
[03:01:28] whether we had PCOS or not. So dealing with insulin almost all of us women, we
[03:01:34] deal with insulin resistance at some point in our life at different degrees. But that goes to the uh you know what I
[03:01:41] was telling you when you load the gun with your genetics and you pull the trigger with epigenetics, your diet,
[03:01:46] your exercise, your sleep, your stress, all of that will affect it long term.
[03:01:51] What can women do to prolong their fertility? I suppose everything you've already talked about, but you see, but now you know how to
[03:01:58] answer it. Don't dismiss your endometriosis. Don't dismiss your PCOS. Know your egg count. Make sure you
[03:02:05] freeze your eggs early if you can afford it. You know, I mean, all the steps we talked about for the past four hours.
[03:02:12] I could listen to you for many, many hours and I know the the audience can too. Um, several things. First of all,
[03:02:20] thank you for coming here today to share with us a true treasure trove of information. I mean, I have to imagine
[03:02:27] that most of what people heard, they have not heard before, and certainly not with the depth and rigor and actionable
[03:02:33] items that you've suggested. So, just thank you. Thank you. Thank you for taking the time. You you're very busy.
[03:02:39] You have four children. You you're happily married. You run a a a very active clinic and your uh story about
[03:02:45] running off to deliver babies at a rate of 80 or more per month while pregnant
[03:02:51] um says it all. but that you would take the time to come here and share with our audience, the general public, that is um
[03:02:58] I'm immensely grateful. I know they are immensely grateful. We will put links so that people can find you and the various
[03:03:04] resources discussed as well as um another call to action to listen to shemd uh your podcast. I also just want
[03:03:12] to thank you for being you, you know, which is a sort of a funny statement on the surface, but truly I mean your
[03:03:17] passion for what you do, your passion for women's health and just the again the depth and rigor with which you
[03:03:24] approach these things that I think for most people they you know look up one or two things see a few symptoms you know
[03:03:30] this age to this age group and you're giving people tools to potentially diagnose their own endometriosis PCOS
[03:03:37] and breast cancer extend fertility live life with far less pain, ideally no
[03:03:44] pain, and perhaps most importantly to give them clarity and the sense that
[03:03:49] they are indeed sane in a world that basically is sending back the opposite message because it just
[03:03:56] doesn't understand what they're going through. So, um, you know, words really can't say enough for how grateful I am
[03:04:02] to have you here and to share this knowledge and that the audience is sure to glean from you. I would really like
[03:04:08] to have you back again to talk about where these things are going because it sounds like the field is advancing very quickly too. And everybody out there um
[03:04:16] head to the various resources that Dr. Aliabody shared and um and please share with me and thanking her uh through her
[03:04:24] social media channels, her podcast and and all the rest. And just you know really truly thank you. Thank you. Thank
[03:04:30] you so much. Oh, you're so sweet. Thank you for having me. Thank you for giving me this opportunity, this mic so I can take, you
