[00:00] Hi!
[00:01] You’re on a rock.
[00:02] Floating in space.
[00:03] Surrounded by more rocks.
[00:04] And gas.
[00:05] And a bunch of nothing, mainly.
[00:06] Oh hey, look at that, the rocks are going
around the gas.
[00:08] Hold on, what the heck, is going on here?
[00:11] To understand, let’s look a little bit of
Physics.
[00:13] Wait, did I say a little bit?
[00:17] To find out what kind of magic this is, we’ll
have to go back in time.
[00:20] Okay, not that far.
[00:23] Stop!
[00:24] Yeah.
[00:25] That’s perfect.
[00:26] This is gravity guy.
[00:27] But most people call him “Isaac Newton”.
[00:28] One important thing he said is that Force
equals mass times acceleration.
[00:31] Now what do all these words even mean?
[00:33] Force is just a push or pull on something,
in a certain direction.
[00:36] Mass tells you how much of something there
is, and it’s also a measure of inertia,
[00:39] but we’ll get to that later, and acceleration
is the derivative of velocity with respect
[00:43] to time, but that’s too many big words for
my taste, so let’s just say it’s how fast
[00:47] velocity is changing.
[00:48] The key takeaway is that if you apply a Force
to a fixed mass, you get a predictable amount
[00:52] of acceleration.
[00:53] If you know all the forces acting on a basketball
mid-air, you can predict with 100% certainty
[00:57] if the ball will go in the hoop or your neighbours
windshield.
[01:01] “Whoa, did an apple just fall on my head?”
[01:05] Yes Newton, it did.
[01:07] “That must have happened for a reason”
said Newton, as he discovered that two masses
[01:10] attract one another, making the apple fall.
[01:13] Yes, even you, no matter how ugly you think
you are, attract pretty much the whole universe,
[01:17] at least a little bit.
[01:18] Hey, can you put that on paper?
[01:19] “yup” said Newton, who gave us the Law
of Universal Gravitation.
[01:23] In other words, how much two bodies pull on
each other, given their mass and distance,
[01:26] times a constant.
[01:27] Bigger mass?
[01:28] Bigger Pull.
[01:29] Bigger distance?
[01:30] Smaller pull.
[01:31] Actually, a lot smaller pull.
[01:32] You see, the as the distance increases, the
Force gets smaller by the square.
[01:36] That my friends, is the Inverse-Square Law.
[01:38] Gravity is also the reason why the planets
in our solar system orbit the sun.
[01:42] They got their initial velocity when the solar
system formed out of spinning gas, and since
[01:46] there’s nothing in space to stop them from
moving, they’ll keep moving.
[01:49] Hey, that’s Newton’s first Law.
[01:51] The sun is so massive, that the force of gravity
keeps pulling the planets towards the sun,
[01:55] but the planets are fast enough to essentially
fall towards the sun but miss it, and this
[01:59] goes on forever, creating a round orbit.
[02:01] Actually, that’s kind of a lie.
[02:03] Most orbits orbits are not perfectly round
but more egg-shaped and pluto’s orbit is
[02:07] just…a complete mess.
[02:08] But you get the idea.
[02:09] In this case, the gravity is what we call
a centripetal force.
[02:13] One thing many people confuse is mass and
weight, and no, they are not the same.
[02:16] Mass tells you how much of this blob there
is, and Weight is the force of Gravity the
[02:20] blob would feel.
[02:21] To make things clear, your mass would be the
same on the earth and on the moon, but the
[02:25] “weight” you would perceive, is different,
because the moon has a weaker gravitational
[02:28] pull, meaning, a weaker force acting on your
mass.
[02:31] So really, you’re not overweight, you’re
just on the wrong planet.
[02:34] Aight, enough about Newton, let’s break
some stuff.
[02:36] If you ever dropped your phone, it might look
like this: What the hell ground, why’d you
[02:40] do that?
[02:41] The answer is Energy.
[02:42] You know, the thing kids have after eating
gummy bears.
[02:45] Energy has the unit Joule.
[02:46] And it’s not like Force, it’s doesn’t
have a direction, it’s just a number, that’s
[02:49] kind of chilling there, as a property of a
thing.
[02:51] You see, there’s two main kinds of energy:
Kinetic energy, and potential energy.
[02:55] In plain English, energy of movement, and
stored energy due to some circumstance.
[02:59] For example, when you held your phone, it
stored gravitational potential energy, due
[03:02] to being held above the ground, at a certain
height.
[03:05] Once you dropped it, the potential energy
was converted into kinetic energy, as the
[03:09] phone fell.
[03:10] Then it smashed into the ground, and the phone
absorbed some of the energy making the screen
[03:13] go boom.
[03:15] Work is defined as Force applied over distance.
[03:17] For example:
If you lift an apple by 1 meter, you would
[03:19] have done about 1 Joule of work.
[03:21] This happened by converting chemical energy
stored in your body to gravitational potential
[03:24] energy stored in the apple.
[03:26] As you may have noticed, Energy and Work have
the same unit “Joule”.
[03:29] So they must be the same thing?
[03:31] Uhhh, No.
[03:33] Energy is the total amount of work that a
thing could possibly do.
[03:36] Work is just the stuff that actually happened
and required energy.
[03:38] You know, force applied over a distance, which
most often implies converting energy from
[03:39] one form to another.
[03:40] If you try to lift a weight that’s too heavy
for you, you’d feel like that took a bunch
[03:42] of work, right?
[03:43] Well, yes, but your feelings are invalid in
the face of Physics!
[03:47] Mathematically, no work has been done!
[03:49] Because, work is a force applied over a distance.
[03:51] And since you didn’t move the weight at
all, no distance means no work.
[03:55] The key thing to remember about energy is
that it cannot be created or destroyed, only
[03:59] converted.
[04:00] Aka, the conservation of energy.
[04:01] Okay, but a car, that’s moving has kinetic
energy.
[04:04] When the car stops, assuming the car doesn’t
smash into a wall, where does that energy
[04:09] go?
[04:10] When you apply the brakes, there’s friction
between the brakes and the wheels, causing
[04:12] the car to slow down, and creating heat as
a byproduct.
[04:16] That heat is then dissipated to the surrounding
air.
[04:18] And that makes the molecules in the air move
faster.
[04:21] And things that move have kinetic energy.
[04:23] So ultimately, the kinetic energy is transferred
from the car to the air.
[04:26] With this knowledge, we can define that Temperature
is just the average kinetic energy of atoms
[04:30] in a system.
[04:31] You see, all atoms, not just molecules in
the air, wiggle.
[04:34] Like this.
[04:35] The faster they move, the hotter things get.
[04:37] That is temperature.
[04:39] All that talk about hot stuff, I think it’s
time we talk about Thermodynamics.
[04:42] It tells us that jumping in lava is probably
a bad idea, but more importantly, the absolute
[04:47] mess that is entropy.
[04:48] Literally, it tells you how much disorder
there is in a system, indicating the number
[04:52] of possible states a system can be in.
[04:54] For example, get an ice cube, no not that
one, yes that’s perfect, and put it in the
[04:59] sun.
[05:00] The sun will obliterate the ice cube and turn
it into water.
[05:03] Looking at the structure of ice and water,
we can see that ice is more neatly organized
[05:06] than water, which just kind of goes all over
the place.
[05:09] Also, the water could look like this, or this,
or even this, but the ice will always look
[05:13] a little something like this.
[05:15] In total, the system went from low entropy
to high entropy, meaning more disorder and
[05:19] more possible microstates.
[05:21] This trend applies everything.
[05:22] The whole universe is on an unstoppable path
to higher entropy.
[05:25] It’s also the reason why time seems to go
only forwards, or at least, that’s what
[05:29] we believe at this point.
[05:30] Practically, entropy tells us that some forms
of energy are more useful for doing work than
[05:33] others.
[05:34] Burn some gasoline, and your car will move,
spitting out heat and gas.
[05:37] That heat and gas is pretty much gasoline,
just in the form of higher entropy.
[05:41] And as you can imagine, this stuff won’t
really make your car move, and the gas won’t
[05:44] spontaneously turn back into liquid gasoline.
[05:46] Meaning, the form of gasoline with lower entropy
is more useful for doing work.
[05:51] Okay, but if you put some water in the freezer,
will it not decrease in entropy?
[05:55] Yes, BUT the fridge is not an isolated system
and will heat up the room more than it will
[06:00] cool down the water, increasing the total
entropy.
[06:02] Wanna see some magic?
[06:04] Woah, what just happened?
[06:06] Some electrons apparently moved through some
wires and let there be light.
[06:11] What is going on here?
[06:13] Objects have a fancy something called a charge.
[06:14] It can be positive or negative.
[06:16] Or, if you have the same amount of both, an
object is neutral.
[06:19] Electrons have a single negative charge.
[06:20] The flow of electrons is called electric current.
[06:22] To describe it, we use three parameters: Current,
Voltage, and Resistance.
[06:26] Current is the amount of electrons passing
through a wire in a given amount of time,
[06:30] Voltage is what pushes the electrons to move,
but simply put, it’s a difference in electric
[06:34] potential, so you can imagine it as a slope
that goes from high potential to low potential,
[06:38] where the flow of current goes downhill, and
resistance is pretty self explanatory.
[06:42] This is Coulomb’s Law.
[06:43] Wait a minute, this is just Newton’s Law
of Gravitation in disguise!
[06:47] This tells us that electric charges attract
each other in a similar way masses do.
[06:51] Opposites want to cuddle, while like charges
literally couldn’t think of a more disgusting
[06:54] thing than to be with one another.
[06:56] These four equations explain pretty much all
of electromagnetism.
[06:59] But don’t be scared just because they look
scary!
[07:01] I mean, yeah, they do, but it’s simpler
than it seems at first.
[07:04] The first one states that if there is an electric
charge, there will be an Electric field, or
[07:07] this big E, emerging form it.
[07:09] Add another and you have an electrostatic
field.
[07:12] These lines tell us in which direction a charged
particle would feel a force at any given point.
[07:16] The second one tells us the same for magnetic
fields, AND, even though electric charges
[07:20] are cool and can be alone, magnetic poles,
are not.
[07:23] They’re very lonely.
[07:24] There will always be a north pole together
with a south pole, and a single pole can never
[07:28] be alone.
[07:29] Okay now here’s where things get kind of
freaky.
[07:32] You know how electric charges only act on
other charges, and magnets only affect other
[07:35] magnets?
[07:36] Well that’s only true if they’re not moving.
[07:38] The third and fourth maxwell equations tell
us that a moving magnet creates an electric
[07:42] field, and a moving charge or electric field
creates a magnetic field.
[07:45] One consequence of this is that current can
seemingly come “out of nowhere” by moving
[07:49] a magnet next to a conductor.
[07:51] The moving magnet creates and electric field,
which makes the electrons inside the conductors
[07:54] go crazy.
[07:56] That is called induction.
[07:57] It’s the reason why your phone charges when
you put in on the charging pad, even though
[07:58] it is not directly connected to a cable.
[07:59] In other words, electric and magnetic fields
are so tightly linked that they are the two
[08:00] parts of the same bigger thing.
[08:02] Let’s say we have a charge.
[08:04] Since it doesn’t move, it has a static electric
field.
[08:06] If we accelerate the charge, there will be
a magnetic field around it.
[08:09] That magnetic field interacts with the electric
field, which again changes the magnetic field,
[08:13] and this is a sort of chain reaction that
makes the electromagnetic field radiate outwards
[08:17] into space as an electromagnetic wave.
[08:19] Depending on the frequency, the human eye
can actually see this, it’s called light,
[08:23] but most of the spectrum is invisible to the
human eye and is used for things such as Bluetooth,
[08:27] wireless charging and confusing human apes
into thinking magic is real.
[08:31] Hey, can we go back to the water and look
at those molecules?
[08:33] Yeah, those, what are they made of?
[08:35] The molecules are made of Atoms.
[08:37] Atoms are made of a core and some electrons.
[08:39] The core is made of protons and neutrons,
both of which are made of quarks.
[08:42] They’re strange yet charming, from up top
down to the bottom.
[08:46] Oh yeah there’s some more stuff, like for
example the overweight brothers of the electron.
[08:50] All of this together makes up the standard
model, which we believe to be the smallest
[08:54] things in the universe.
[08:55] At least that’s the excuse we have for not
knowing what quarks are made of.
[08:58] Fun Fact!
[08:59] Depending on the number of protons in the
core, you get different elements.
[09:02] Depending on the number of Neutrons in the
core, you get different Isotopes of the same
[09:05] element.
[09:06] Most of which are a little overweight and
very unstable.
[09:08] So they fall apart, into smaller atoms.
[09:11] That releases ionizing radiation.
[09:13] Not so fun fact: That stuff will kill you.
[09:15] Do not play with radioactive atoms.
[09:16] If you have a large group of atoms, you can
predict when half of those will have fallen
[09:18] apart.
[09:19] That’s the halflife.
[09:20] Depending on how unstable an isotope is, it
will survive a certain amount of time.
[09:23] Some don’t want to live, some really don’t
want to live, but some will live far longer
[09:27] than you probably will.
[09:28] Oh yeah, did I mention that light is like
the fastest thing in the universe?
[09:32] To be exact, 299, 792, 458 meters per second
in a vacuum.
[09:38] “That is pretty fast” said everyone.
[09:41] Also, “Light is a wave” said everyone.
[09:43] Why?
[09:44] If you shoot it through two teeny tiny slits
it creates a fancy pattern due to interference,
[09:47] which is just a wave thing.
[09:49] You see, when two waves cross, they can add
up, or cancel each other out.
[09:52] These gaps, are the spots where they cancel
each other out, so in this case, light behaves
[09:56] like a wave.
[09:57] “Nah, screw that, everything you know is
wrong” said Albert Einstein, probably smoking
[10:02] crack, after hearing about the photoelectric
effect and discovering that light comes in
[10:05] tiny packets called photons.
[10:07] I sure hope that doesn’t unravel a whole
new area of phyiscs, haha.
[10:11] “Anyway” he said, as he continued to casually
drop an absolute bomb on the entire field
[10:16] of physics with his theory of relativity:
He assumed the speed of light is constant
[10:20] because it arises from two other constants.
[10:22] He also assumed the laws of physics are the
same for everyone, regardless if moving or
[10:26] at rest.
[10:27] Now think about it: If two people turn on
a flashlight, but one person is standing still,
[10:30] while the other person is on a moving train,
wouldn’t the person standing still see the
[10:34] other person’s light as going faster than
the speed of light?
[10:37] The reality is: NO!
[10:39] It would be the same as their own flashlight.
[10:41] That’s impossible, except if time passes
slower for that person from the perspective
[10:44] of this person.
[10:46] In other words, if the speed of light is constant,
time must be relative.
[10:49] Also, gravity is not actually a Force, sorry
Newton, but rather a consequence of masses
[10:53] bending spacetime.
[10:55] Einstein thought that the universe is a mesh
of space and time, and anything with a mass
[10:58] bends this fabric.
[11:00] Also, all objects move freely on a straight
line when moving through space.
[11:04] Gravitation is simply the result of objects
following these bent lines, which appear straight
[11:07] to them.
[11:08] If you have a hard time understanding this,
you can imagine two people on earth, walking
[11:11] in parallel, straight lines.
[11:12] On a short distance, the straight lines will
never meet.
[11:13] Now imagine one standing on the east cost,
and one the west coast of the US.
[11:16] If they both walk north, eventually, they
will meet at the north pole.
[11:20] Because of the curvature of the earth, they
ended up at the same point even though they
[11:23] both walked “straight” relative to themselves.
[11:25] “Oh yeah by the way Energy and mass are
kind of the same thing” he added, which
[11:28] explains why atom bombs are so frickin powerful.
[11:31] According to this formula, even just tiny
atoms can release a humongous amount of energy
[11:35] by giving up just a fraction of their mass
during fission.
[11:39] What is Fission?
[11:40] It’s the same thing Oppenheimer used to
make this thing go boom.
[11:42] You see, there’s two main ways to gain energy
from changing nuclei: Fission and Fusion.
[11:46] Fission aims to split the nucleus of an atom
into two or more smaller nuclei, which is
[11:50] most often achieved by blasting the core with
neutrons.
[11:53] Fusion is the opposite, where you combine
two smaller nuclei to get one bigger one.
[11:57] The energy came from something we call a “mass
defect” where the resulting nucleus is lighter
[12:01] than the starting nuclei.
[12:02] This “missing” mass is what was converted
to energy during Fusion.
[12:06] Fission and Fusion are cool, but you have
got to be careful or you might just blow up
[12:09] the planet.
[12:10] That totally didn’t almost happen before…multiple
times.
[12:13] Hey remember when Einstein said light is a
particle?
[12:16] He accidentally discovered a whole new field
of physics which he though is just a giant
[12:20] hoax: Quantum Mechanics.
[12:21] This stuff is crazy.
[12:23] Another german guy called Max Planck said
“yes, Einstein, you’re right.
[12:26] Light does come in tiny packets.
[12:27] Actually, all energy comes in tiny packets”.
[12:30] Or “Quanta”.
[12:31] He is the daddy of Quantum Mechanics.
[12:32] Wanna know where an electron is inside an
atom?
[12:33] It’s here!
[12:34] And there!
[12:35] And everywhere, at the same time, actually!
[12:36] That’s a superposition.
[12:37] It’s not in one state, it’s in multiple
states at once - at least until you measure
[12:41] it.
[12:42] Then it chooses one cozy spot to be in.
[12:44] Schrödinger gave us an equation that gives
you a probabilistic model of where you can
[12:47] find it if you were to measure.
[12:49] You can imagine this as a cloud, and the denser
it is, the more likely it is for an electron
[12:53] to be there.
[12:54] But still, where exactly it will end up once
you measure it, is random.
[12:57] Speaking of observing particles, they’re
also super sensitive about their private data.
[13:01] Look at these two images of a flying ball:
in one, you can clearly see where the ball
[13:04] is, but not in which direction it’s moving,
and in the other you can see where it’s
[13:08] moving and approximately how fast, but not
where exactly it is at the moment.
[13:12] That is essentially Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle: You can never know both the exact
[13:16] position and the exact speed of a quantum
particle at the same time.
[13:19] Okay, let’s recap, a small thing can be
a particle and a wave at the same time, and
[13:22] when we try to look at them, weird stuff happens.
[13:24] But you know what, it gets even weirder.
[13:27] Think back to the double slit experiment:
We know that a light beam acts as a bunch
[13:30] of waves and we get interference.
[13:31] But here’s the weird thing: Even if you
send individual photons, after sending enough
[13:36] of them and detecting where they end up, you
get interference.
[13:38] Like, how can that be?
[13:40] What did a single particle interfere with?
[13:42] Well, we think it interfered with itself,
because it acted as a wave and went through
[13:45] both slits at the same time.
[13:48] That’s a superposition.
[13:49] “Okay, well let’s just measure which slit
it goes through”.
[13:51] Uh, yeah, that’s not going to happen.
[13:53] Once you start measuring which slit the photon
goes through, it stops acting like a wave
[13:56] and the interference pattern disappears, as
every particle chooses just one of the slits
[14:00] to go through.
[14:01] Sounds kinda suspicious to me.
[14:03] Anyways, all this knowledge is going to cost
you one subscribe and a thumbs up, thank you
[14:07] very much, and you can decide if maybe you’d
want to tip with a comment, perhaps?
