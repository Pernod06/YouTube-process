[00:00] [audience applause]
[00:03] These are the 7 most powerful men in China.
[00:06] They represent the top leadership positions
of the ruling party...
[00:09] and their identities are revealed 
every five years...
[00:11] at a carefully choreographed 
political event
[00:14] called the National Congress.
[00:16] “China's Communist Party unveiled 
its new leadership
[00:18] over the next five years.”
[00:20] The order of appearance is symbolic.
[00:22] The first person to emerge
[00:23] is the head of the party 
for the next five years.
[00:26] At the most recent event 
in October 2022...
[00:29] that person was Xi Jinping
[00:31] China's president for the last ten years...
[00:33] who walked out in the top spot 
a historic third time
[00:36] after getting rid of China's 
presidential term limit
[00:38] that restricted all his predecessors 
to two terms.
[00:41] A signal that he may be planning 
to stay in power for life.
[00:45] The world hasn't seen a Chinese leader like this
[00:48] since Mao Zedong...
[00:49] the revolutionary founder of the 
People's Republic of China...
[00:52] whose ruthless dictatorship
[00:54] scarred the Chinese people 
for generations.
[00:57] Xi has been compared to Mao a lot.
[00:59] And he clearly draws from Mao's playbook.
[01:02] But there's something else 
that connects these two.
[01:05] When Xi was just a young boy...
[01:07] Mao ruined his life.
[01:09] Generations apart, their paths 
crossed unexpectedly
[01:12] and a teenage Xi from an 
elite family in Beijing...
[01:16] ended up in exile.
[01:17] Condemned to hard labor in the countryside.
[01:20] 50 years later
[01:21] Xi is one of the most powerful 
political figures in the world
[01:24] and the only leader since Mao
[01:26] to have unchecked power over China.
[01:29] So how did he go from 
being banished in his country...
[01:32] to taking complete control of it?
[01:35] [sinister, electronic music]
[01:39] [music fades]
[01:41] Xi Jinping's connection to Mao formed
[01:43] long before Xi was even born.
[01:45] [dark, pensive music]
[01:48] It goes back to when a bloody civil war 
was raging in China.
[01:52] A group of radical communist 
revolutionaries, including Mao
[01:56] gained influence over large swaths 
of mainland China...
[01:59] and controlled a communist military 
called the Red Army...
[02:02] that fought the Nationalist Party
[02:04] ruling the Republic of China at the time.
[02:07] At this point, the Communists 
were losing bad.
[02:10] The bulk of their army was pinned down here...
[02:12] in a communist controlled region
originally established by Mao...
[02:16] now surrounded by Nationalist forces.
[02:18] And they were running low on food.
[02:20] So the Red Army decided to 
launch a bold attack...
[02:23] to break through the Nationalist forces
and evacuate the roughly
[02:27] 130,000 communist soldiers 
and civilians stuck here.
[02:32] On October 16th, 1934, 
they made their move...
[02:35] and attacked a weaker part 
of the enemy line.
[02:38] They broke through.
[02:39] And even though their numbers 
quickly dropped
[02:41] with thousands dying and 
thousands more
[02:43] fleeing to the countryside...
[02:45] around 86,000 stuck together and pushed on.
[02:49] This was the beginning of a year-long
[02:51] historic retreat called the Long March.
[02:54] The journey to establish a new communist base...
[02:56] far from the Nationalist forces.
[03:01] Mao, who used to be a military leader
[03:03] wasn't in charge at this time.
[03:05] He'd insisted on using 
guerrilla tactics
[03:07] which had heavily influenced 
the Red Army earlier in the war.
[03:10] But that approach had fallen out of favor
and he was demoted.
[03:14] The Long March changed that.
[03:16] After escaping the siege here
[03:17] the Red Army continued to suffer
relentless attacks
[03:20] by the pursuing Nationalist army.
[03:22] The military leaders of the march
[03:23] had pushed for a more traditional 
wartime strategy
[03:25] of direct confrontation...
[03:27] rather than Mao's guerrilla tactics.
[03:29] And the result was catastrophic 
for the Red Army.
[03:32] Less than half of the original 
escape group
[03:34] survived the first three months alone.
[03:36] So it was at this first stopping point
[03:38] where Communist Party leader 
Zhou Enlai...
[03:40] handed military leadership back to Mao.
[03:43] And Mao picked an end point 
for the march... here.
[03:47] 800 miles away in rural northern China.
[03:50] But they didn't go straight for it.
[03:52] Mao led the Red Army 
deep into the mountains
[03:54] where he predicted 
lighter resistance.
[03:57] And he was right.
[03:58] But the journey was still brutal.
[04:01] It was nine more months 
of nonstop marching
[04:03] and fighting along this 
several thousand mile route...
[04:06] before they ultimately arrived 
in northern China...
[04:09] where a guerrilla base led by 
a communist revolutaionary
[04:12] named Xi Zhongxun, offered
Mao's army refuge...
[04:15] bringing the Long March 
to an end.
[04:19] That man was Xi Jinping's father.
[04:24] In the end, fewer than 8,000 
of the original marchers survived.
[04:29] Even though thousands died 
on the Long March
[04:31] from starvation and fighting and disease...
[04:34] Mao's leadership was credited
[04:35] with saving the Red Army
from total annihilation.
[04:38] And he became the de facto 
head of the party
[04:40] as well as the military...
[04:42] entrusted with rebuilding the army
[04:43] to take on the Nationalist forces 
for total control of China.
[04:47] “Wherever and however...
[04:50] the Red Troops move into battle...
[04:52] they spread the glory of Mao Zedong.”
[04:56] This is a good stopping point 
in the story to talk about how
[04:58] power in the Chinese Communist Party 
or CCP works.
[05:02] Officially, the highest level of authority
[05:04] is a group called the Central Committee
[05:06] and is responsible for all of the party's 
major policy decisions.
[05:10] Within the Central Committee 
is a select group of officials
[05:13] called the Political Bureau or Politburo.
[05:16] In most Communist parties,
like that of the former Soviet Union...
[05:20] the Politburo represents the most powerful
members of the party
[05:23] besides the General Secretary.
[05:25] But the Chinese Communist Party 
has a key distinction
[05:27] that makes it unique.
[05:29] It has one more 
even smaller selection
[05:31] of top officials who ultimately 
have the final say.
[05:34] An elite class of Politburo members
called the Politburo Standing Committee.
[05:38] This group, which includes the General Secretary
[05:41] holds supreme control over 
the Central Committee
[05:43] dictates the will of the party 
and is in full control
[05:46] of the Central Military Commission
[05:48] which oversees China's defense.
[05:51] Mao's promotion during the Long March 
landed him here
[05:54] in the highest position of the military
[05:56] and the Politburo Standing Committee.
[05:58] Even though he was considered 
the de facto head of the party
[06:00] when the Long March ended in 1935...
[06:03] he officially became head of the party in 1943.
[06:07] With both the party and the military 
under his control...
[06:09] Mao began to exploit the system to ensure
[06:12] he remained at the top for the rest of his life.
[06:17] At Mao's first National Congress
[06:18] as the official party leader in 1945...
[06:21] the party introduced a resolution 
that brought his influence
[06:24] to a whole new level.
[06:27] They unified the party around a single 
understanding of its history...
[06:30] and declared Mao's political ideology
[06:33] later called Mao Tse-Tung Thought 
or Maoism...
[06:35] as the unquestioned guiding principle
[06:37] of the Chinese Communist Party.
[06:39] Basically, Mao's ideas or policy decisions
[06:42] could no longer be challenged by anyone.
[06:45] It was here he unveiled his equivalent
at the time
[06:47] of the Politburo Standing Committee.
[06:49] The four other top party leaders...
[06:51] all long marchers deeply loyal to Mao.
[06:54] Like Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai...
[06:57] who would go on to hold some of 
the most powerful positions
[06:59] in the future government.
[07:01] Four years later, Mao declared
final victory for the Communists
[07:04] in a decades long Chinese civil war
[07:06] and established a new country:
[07:08] The People's Republic of China, 
or PRC.
[07:11] “Mao Tse-tung, once a lowly party worker...
[07:14] now assumed the stature of a dominant figure
[07:17] in all of Eastern Asia.”
[07:20] But winning a revolution isn't the same 
as running a country.
[07:24] Because now that you're running a country
[07:25] there's all these other things you have to do
[07:27] like deliver the mail and like build a dam 
and stuff like that.
[07:31] You can't possibly have the party 
do all these things.
[07:35] So the party set up a government that would take
[07:37] the policy decisions made by the 
Politburo Standing Committee
[07:40] and figure out a way to make them a reality.
[07:42] And so it evolved to a system where...
[07:45] the party would make all 
the important decisions...
[07:48] and especially the Politburo Standing Committee.
[07:52] Then, as it is today...
[07:54] many of these decisions would go to 
the State Council.
[07:57] So the State Council was the highest 
decision-making body
[08:00] on the state side, led by 
the Premier of China.
[08:04] The Premier of China, by the way, 
is almost always
[08:07] a member of the Politburo Standing Committee.
[08:10] One way Mao kept a tight grip on power 
over the years
[08:13] was by promoting those loyal to him 
to top positions
[08:15] in the party in government.
[08:17] Whether they had government experience or not.
[08:20] For example, Zhou Enlai...
[08:22] the former party leader
[08:23] who helped Mao rise to power 
during the Long March...
[08:26] became China's first premier.
[08:29] The advantage of that is that 
they could never challenge him.
[08:31] The disadvantage of that is
[08:33] they didn't know what they were doing
[08:34] and so administration suffered...
[08:37] policy outcomes suffered.
[08:41] Long March survivors often became 
party elites under Mao.
[08:44] Xi Jinping's father, for example, 
was appointed
[08:47] Secretary General of the State Council...
[08:49] and as the son of a Long Marcher
[08:51] young Xi was given the informal title 
of Princeling.
[08:55] Mao succeeded in never giving up 
his power during his lifetime.
[08:58] His unchecked policies resulted 
in massive famines
[09:01] and widespread persecution
[09:03] that cost between 40 and 80 million lives 
over a span of decades...
[09:07] and culminated in the disastrous 
Cultural Revolution.
[09:10] A violent final attempt from Mao 
to consolidate his power
[09:13] and force loyalty to the practice of Maoism.
[09:17] The idea was to make himself 
and his ideas eternal.
[09:21] The way he viewed communist figureheads
[09:22] like Lenin and Marx before him.
[09:25] Anyone that didn't fall in line with
Mao’s ideology
[09:27] was publicly humiliated...
[09:29] impoverished...
[09:30] excluded from society, and, 
in many cases
[09:32] executed.
[09:34] Either at the hands of the army...
[09:36] or by a militant youth group obsessed 
with enforcing Maoism:
[09:39] The Red Guards.
[09:41] [cheering]
[09:51] Even those closest to the dictator
[09:53] weren’t safe from his purges during 
the Cultural Revolution.
[09:57] High level officials
[09:58] including members of the 
Politburo Standing Committee
[10:00] and Long Marchers...
[10:01] were removed from their positions.
[10:03] Liu Shaoqi was denounced 
as a traitor and died
[10:06] while imprisoned under harsh conditions.
[10:08] Mao also removed the Chief of Staff of the Army
[10:11] and replaced him with a Maoist...
[10:13] leaving no one left to oppose him 
in the military.
[10:15] Mao's handpicked successor
[10:17] who always appeared loyally by his side
[10:19] in photos and propaganda posters
[10:21] died under mysterious circumstances
[10:23] when his plane crashed as he was 
fleeing to the Soviet Union.
[10:27] Mao later denounced him as a traitor.
[10:29] He denounced Xi's father, too.
[10:31] This is a photo of Xi senior
[10:33] being restrained and publicly criticized
[10:35] by the Red Guards at the height 
of the Cultural Revolution.
[10:38] He would remain a prisoner in Beijing 
for 8 years following this.
[10:43] With his father purged...
[10:44] Xi Jinping, 15 at the time
[10:46] was expelled from his 
elite school in Beijing
[10:48] and sent to work in the countryside.
[10:51] He had to live in a cave and
do hard manual labor.
[10:55] His food was barely enough for
[10:58] a growing young person.
[11:01] And Chairman Mao was responsible for all of it.
[11:05] But then... Mao died.
[11:08] The Cultural Revolution ended.
[11:10] His successor was Deng Xiaoping...
[11:12] one of the Politburo Standing 
Committee members
[11:14] who was removed from power 
during the Cultural Revolution.
[11:17] Who just before Mao died...
[11:19] started making a promise 
to fellow exiled party veterans.
[11:23] Deng Xiaoping signaled credibly...
[11:26] to all the surviving Long Marchers
[11:28] that he wanted to rehabilitate people.
[11:31] So when Mao died, they all supported 
the rehabilitation of Deng.
[11:34] And as soon as Deng was rehabilitated
[11:36] he went ahead and rehabilitated 
all these people.
[11:39] With experienced leadership back in place
[11:41] the party needed to figure out
[11:43] how to prevent something like this...
[11:49] from ever happening again.
[11:51] In order to undo Mao's 
cult of personality...
[11:54] the party introduced a second 
historical resolution in 1981.
[11:58] It condemned periods of Mao's rule...
[12:00] and emphasized a renewed commitment 
to collective leadership...
[12:04] vowing to oppose the consolidation of power
[12:06] around one person moving forward.
[12:08] The successors to Mao 
didn't want a dictatorship.
[12:12] So they divided up these positions
[12:15] and put them in the hands of different people.
[12:18] Like Mao, Deng kept tight control
[12:20] over the Central Military Commission
as its chairman...
[12:23] and held a leadership position 
in the government.
[12:25] But was never head of state.
[12:27] He never held the highest position in the party either.
[12:29] Instead, he set up a new advisory commission
[12:32] and served as its chairman...
[12:33] which allowed him to influence 
the party's direction...
[12:36] without positioning himself 
directly on top of it.
[12:39] This allowed a power sharing structure
[12:40] while still making Deng the 
de facto leader of China
[12:43] until he stepped down in 1989...
[12:45] following the Army's massacre of students 
protesting in Tiananmen Square.
[12:49] “A protester suddenly ran into 
the middle of the street
[12:53] and in front of the oncoming tanks.”
[12:55] “Anger at Deng Xiaoping, the entire 
Chinese government...
[12:58] it had the real feeling of rebellion
in the streets of Beijing.”
[13:03] “People want to fight the military 
out of their city.”
[13:08] Deng and his ideology
[13:09] which moved away from Maoism, 
set a precedent of sharing power.
[13:13] He opened up China and 
established economic ties
[13:16] with these countries...
[13:17] and was the first PRC leader 
to visit the US in 1979.
[13:21] “Today, we take another step in the historic...
[13:24] normalization of relations
[13:26] which we have begun this year.”
[13:29] Deng’s reforms became the foundation
[13:31] for decades of economic prosperity
[13:33] that led China to having the world's 
second largest economy over time...
[13:36] and being on the verge of becoming 
the world's next superpower.
[13:40] “Communism is creating a consumer society.”
[13:42] “Also reminds you that the standard of living
in China is going up.”
[13:46] “Here... capitalism rules.”
[13:49] One thing power sharing did lead to...
[13:53] was a lot of policy innovation
[13:56] and then some degree of decentralization.
[13:59] And both of these things helped 
China's economy enormously.
[14:05] Which is why this period of 
economic growth and reform
[14:08] stretching over roughly 30 years 
is known as the Deng era.
[14:11] Whether he wanted to or not,
Deng kept his word...
[14:13] and never tried to consolidate 
absolute power around himself.
[14:17] He did end up sharing power.
[14:19] And that set the stage for 
power sharing in the party...
[14:24] until the rise of Xi Jinping.
[14:27] So what was Xi doing all this time?
[14:29] [contemplative music]
[14:31] When Mao died in 1976
[14:33] Xi was back in Beijing studying 
communist philosophy...
[14:37] even though the Chinese Communist Party 
had ruined Xi's family...
[14:40] He had joined it.
[14:41] Just as the Cultural Revolution 
was winding down.
[14:44] But why?
[14:45] Personally, he might begrudge 
Chairman Mao
[14:48] for doing all this terrible things to his family...
[14:51] but I think at this time he also 
recognized that in the system
[14:55] of the Chinese Communist Party 
power is everything.
[14:59] Without power, you're nothing.
[15:01] But in order to get that power...
[15:03] Xi did something unexpected.
[15:05] He left Beijing.
[15:06] As his competitors
were fiercely competing
[15:09] with each other in the 
1980s and 1990s.
[15:12] He sort of got out of their way...
[15:14] and went to the provinces.
[15:17] He took positions in party leadership
[15:18] in rural, poor provinces 
all around China...
[15:21] where there were no other 
princelings to compete with.
[15:24] First, in Hebei, a poor rural province 
outside of Beijing...
[15:28] where he easily reached the top spot 
as party secretary.
[15:31] Then in Fujian, a heavily militarized region
[15:34] where top members of the army
were stationed.
[15:36] He moved up the ranks 
to party secretary here, too.
[15:38] Before becoming the governor of the province 
a few years later.
[15:42] After making powerful friends in the military...
[15:44] Xi went here... where he once again
[15:46] assumes the office of party secretary...
[15:48] and grew his support on the civilian side.
[15:52] This strategy of moving around
[15:53] didn't just give Xi 
a leg up in areas
[15:55] where competition was slim.
[15:57] It also gave him credibility...
[15:59] as a humble, hard working 
party leader...
[16:01] and he cultivated a growing group of supporters
[16:04] who would come back into play 
years down the line.
[16:08] It was his last stop and his shortest one
[16:11] that ultimately got him back to Beijing.
[16:14] A brief stint in the top party spot 
in Shanghai in 2007...
[16:17] where he rehabilitated the city's image
[16:19] following a high-level corruption scandal.
[16:22] Xi developed a reputation here
[16:23] as a prudent leader who toed the party line.
[16:26] Just 7 months later, he finally 
returned to Beijing...
[16:29] having been promoted to the all-powerful 
Politburo Standing Committee.
[16:33] Basically, the people who were deciding
on top leadership at the time
[16:38] they wanted a Princeling.
[16:39] But they didn't want a princeling
[16:41] who was too ambitious or too strong.
[16:44] So Xi Jinping
[16:45] he was seen as less ambitious
[16:48] because he was willing to go 
to the countryside
[16:50] and work in lower-level positions.
[16:54] When Xi emerged as the 2007
[16:55] National Congress and leadership unveiling...
[16:57] he was one of the 9 most powerful men 
in the country.
[17:01] It was at this moment that his 
strategic climb...
[17:03] over 17 long years in the countryside paid off.
[17:07] Big time.
[17:09] When the General Secretary 
stepped down in 2012...
[17:12] Xi emerged at the top spot 
in the party as China's leader.
[17:15] Now the elite son of a former revolutionary
[17:19] turned exiled peasant...
[17:20] turned party darling...
[17:22] was poised to seize control of everything.
[17:28] Like Mao, Xi Jinping believes 
that rallying around
[17:31] a single figure is crucial 
to the party's survival.
[17:34] Rather than the collective leadership
[17:36] Deng’s reforms had normalized.
[17:37] So pretty much as soon as 
Xi Jinping came to power.
[17:40] He started getting rid of people.
[17:43] “The news... four top officials
removed for taking bribes
[17:48] was announced on state TV.”
[17:49] “Xi Jinping has just sacked his foreign minister.”
[17:52] “Just sacked his defense minister.”
[17:54] “He sacked a whole lot of 
other people at the top
[17:56] of the military establishment.”
[17:58] “The former security czar
[17:59] has not been seen in public
for more than a year.”
[18:01] “The nvestigation against Zhou 
allows the Chinese president
[18:04] to remove those opposed to his reforms.”
[18:07] He launched a major anti-corruption campaign...
[18:10] as soon as he took power
in late 2012, early ‘13...
[18:15] which led to the arrests of
hundreds of senior-level officials
[18:19] as well as military officers.
[18:22] These purges targeted
Xi's rivals in the party...
[18:25] whose vacant positions he filled 
with his own supporters.
[18:28] After this massive purge...
[18:30] Xi Jinping was in very tight control over
[18:35] both the party and also the Chinese military...
[18:39] thereby making him the most powerful leader
[18:43] of the Chinese Communist Party 
since the death of Mao.
[18:46] That pattern continued in the second term
[18:48] where he unveiled 5 new faces 
of the Politburo Standing Committee...
[18:52] three of them with close 
personal ties to Xi.
[18:55] In 2021, Xi pulled off one of his 
most dramatic acts yet...
[19:00] to enforce his influence over 
the Chinese Communist Party.
[19:04] He introduced a third historic resolution
[19:06] that unified the party's ideology
[19:08] around one clear line of thinking:
[19:10] Xi Jinping Thought.
[19:13] Xi's personal political ideology...
[19:15] would now be the core 
in the party's thinking...
[19:17] political stance and action.
[19:20] Basically, Xi Jinping's ideas 
could no longer be challenged.
[19:24] And they weren't for many years.
[19:27] During Xi's first 10 years in power
[19:29] the size of China's economy 
more than doubled.
[19:32] So did average individual income.
[19:34] So did military spending.
[19:36] Under his leadership...
[19:37] China's presence on the world stage
has grown too.
[19:40] Positioning the rising superpower
[19:41] to take on the role of an aggressor, externally.
[19:44] Reasserting claims over parts 
of the South China Sea
[19:47] Intimidating Taiwan and Tibet
[19:48] and stripping democratic process 
in Hong Kong.
[19:51] Inside its own borders
[19:53] strict Internet censorship and 
surveillance are widespread...
[19:56] and oppression of Uyghurs...
[19:58] a mostly minority Muslim ethnic group...
[20:00] is marked by human rights abuses.
[20:03] But it wasn't until Covid that Xi saw
[20:05] the first real challenge to his authority.
[20:07] “Anger in China is growing.”
[20:10] “Video showing protester is in Xinjiang...
[20:12] fed up with China's zero Covid rules.”
[20:17] “The boldest public challenge yet
for leader Xi Jinping.”
[20:21] With these protests all around the country...
[20:23] and the party's reputation in peril.
[20:26] Xi reversed the failed policy.
[20:28] But is now faced with 
a shaky economy...
[20:31] and cracks in his unchecked authority.
[20:39] It was just weeks before 
the widespread protests
[20:41] at the 20th National Congress in 2022...
[20:45] that Xi walked out in the leading position
a third time.
[20:48] He had already locked in the presidency
for another five years...
[20:52] and unveiled a Politburo Standing Committee
[20:54] completely packed with those loyal to him.
[20:56] After removing the final senior members of the party
[20:59] that had ties to his predecessor.
[21:01] Now there is no one left in party
[21:03] or military leadership whose ideology 
differs from Xi.
[21:07] I don't think anyone can 
push him out at this point.
[21:11] I think Xi will be the most 
powerful leader in China...
[21:16] as long as he's alive and conscious.
