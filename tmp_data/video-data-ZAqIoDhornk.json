    "description": "This video provides an accessible introduction to fundamental physics concepts. It covers key ideas from classical mechanics, energy, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and modern physics, explaining complex topics in an engaging way.",
    "thumbnail": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZAqIoDhornk/maxresdefault.jpg",
    "summary": "This video offers a whirlwind tour of fundamental physics, starting with gravity and Newton's laws. It then explores concepts of energy, work, and the conservation of energy, before delving into temperature, entropy, and the laws of thermodynamics. The video concludes by explaining electromagnetism, the structure of atoms, radioactivity, and the dual nature of light as both a wave and a particle."
