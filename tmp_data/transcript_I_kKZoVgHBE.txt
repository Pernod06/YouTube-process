[46:10] [Music]
[46:23] you have done well katos freed from the bondage of Olympus and
[46:31] cleansed in chaos man kind is now ready to hear my message look around you
[46:39] Athena the world stands in ruin what good is your message go if you must but
[46:47] first I insist you give me the power from inside the Box the box was empty that can't be true
[46:58] I can see it in your eyes you used my power to kill Zeus you still have it as
[47:04] we speak don't you [Music]
[47:10] understand when Zeus gathered all the evils and placed them in the
[47:15] box I dreaded what would happen if it was opened again and so I summoned the most
[47:23] powerful weapon in the world and I placed in the
[47:29] [Music]
[47:36] Box I told you it was empty pator was sacrificed in vain she
[47:45] died because of my need for vengeance you must be mistaken you used
[47:52] my power to kill Zeus I saw you do it
[48:00] unless of course when you opened the box you release the evils to the
[48:08] gods infected them changed
[48:14] [Applause] them Zeus himself felt prey to the dark evils this is why he became so enraged
[48:23] and obsessed with your death she was consumed by the evil
[48:28] Fe I thought the power I placed in the Box was never released all these years I assumed you
[48:36] drew from the evils inside to destroy Aries but I was
[48:47] wrong the power you took from the box is mine from it you gained the strength
[48:53] that Zeus could never destroy a strength great enough to overcome
[49:00] fear locked deep inside of you
[49:07] cratos it has remained buried trapped by your guilt and the failures of your
[49:14] past when you killed Zeus you must have allowed something to awaken it what was
[49:21] it katos hope is what makes us strong it is why we are
[49:27] here it is what we fight with when all else is
[49:32] lost what was it kattos all I remember is what I have
[49:38] lost that is why you should give me the power I understand its true meaning and
[49:44] where it belongs I trust you to do the right thing katos you
[49:51] shouldn't you owe me this katos I I owe you
[49:57] nothing I made you a God I sheltered you from the wrath of
[50:03] Olympus I delivered your revenge on Ze it is over Athena you would dare strike
[50:10] me down again my
[50:16] Vengeance ends now how could
[50:24] you
[50:33] you fool what have you [Music]
[50:40] done
[50:54] no that was meant for me they will not know what to do with
[51:09] [Music] it you disappoint me
