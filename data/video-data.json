    "summary": "Jensen Huang's GTC Washington D.C. keynote explores the AI revolution and America's role in the next computing era. He presents NVIDIA's innovations across accelerated computing, including the 30-year evolution of CUDA and GPUs, the new 6G telecommunications platform (Arc), quantum-GPU hybrid computing (NVQLink), and the transformation of software into AI workers. The keynote emphasizes three new scaling laws (Scale, Post-Training, and Inference) and introduces the Rubin platform—manufactured in America. Strategic partnerships with ServiceNow, SAP, CrowdStrike, and Palantir demonstrate how AI agents will transform enterprise workflows, marking concurrent platform transitions in both accelerated computing and artificial intelligence."
