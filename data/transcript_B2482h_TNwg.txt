======================================================================

[00:00] Inside every modern laptop, smartphone, desktop 
computer, advanced AI server, or practically any
[00:08] other high-tech device are cutting edge microchips 
such as these CPU, GPU, SoC, DRAM, and SSD chips,
[00:19] each with tens of billions of transistors inside 
of them. The transistors inside these microchips
[00:26] are incredibly small with the tiniest features 
measuring around 10 nanometers or 45 silicon
[00:33] atoms. This feat of science and engineering 
may seem impossible because on one hand each
[00:40] of these microchips is made from connecting 
billions upon billions of transistors together,
[00:46] and then on the other hand, each individual 
transistor is only nanometers in size.
[00:52] Additionally, these microchips are 
everywhere and in everything, and therefore
[00:57] they must be reliably mass produced. So how is 
manufacturing such a microchip even possible?
[01:05] These are photolithography tools, and they are 
the key to manufacturing microchips. However,
[01:12] it’s important to note that there are dozens 
of different types of tools used in the various
[01:17] steps for making microchips, and each one plays 
a critical role in the manufacturing process. So,
[01:23] to be accurate, photolithography tools are 
the ones that are used to copy and imprint
[01:29] the nanoscopic patterns of transistors and layers 
of wires onto a microchip and therefore a useful
[01:36] analogy is to think of these photolithography 
tools as nanoscale microchip photocopiers.
[01:44] Photolithography tools have been continuously 
evolving to copy and imprint smaller and smaller
[01:50] transistors and circuitry, and, in this video, 
we’re going dive into this state-of-the-art
[01:56] EUV Photolithography System and explore 
the science and engineering inside of it.
[02:02] So, let’s begin with a quick overview. To start, 
the EUV Lithography Machine takes the design of a
[02:09] single layer of a microchip on what’s called a 
photomask and loads it into the machine. Next,
[02:15] a 300 millimeter silicon wafer with a set of prior 
processes applied to it is placed onto a wafer
[02:23] carrier inside the machine. With both in place, 
the machine uses extreme ultraviolet light or EUV
[02:31] and a set of mirrors to copy the design from the 
photomask onto a silicon wafer. The wafer moves
[02:38] to the next position and the microchip design 
is copied yet again. This copying happens over
[02:44] and over until the wafer is filled with a hundred 
or more microchips and then a new wafer comes in,
[02:50] and the copying starts over. This is the 
real-time speed of the lithography machine,
[02:57] taking about 18 seconds to duplicate the same 
microchip design around a hundred times across
[03:04] the entire area of a 300-millimeter wafer.
Let’s take a look at one of these microchips
[03:10] and see what exactly we’re copying. Inside 
this microchip are approximately 30 billion
[03:17] transistors, and if you were wondering, it’s the 
design of a GPU or graphics processing unit found
[03:24] in the center of a graphics card. When we zoom 
into a nanoscopic view of this microchip we find
[03:30] a 3D maze of transistors and layers upon layers of 
wires with the smallest dimensions of the bottom
[03:37] most layers measuring around 10 nanometers 
or around 45 silicon atoms. Specifically,
[03:45] the EUV Photolithography System typically patterns 
the lower layers with the smallest features,
[03:52] whereas other photolithography tools are used 
to pattern the higher layers. It might be
[03:58] difficult to fully grasp the level of detail and 
complexity inside a single layer of billions of
[04:04] nanoscopic transistors, so let’s use a thought 
experiment and pretend that instead of copying
[04:10] transistors and wires, this EUV photolithography 
system is used to copy the text from a book.
[04:18] If the width of each line of a letter is 13 
nanometers, then the word ‘Cat’ would take up
[04:24] around 155 by 240 nanometers, a page of text 
would be about the size of a red blood cell,
[04:32] and a chapter of a book would be a grain of 
pollen. When we zoom out to see the equivalent
[04:38] area of a GPU chip, how many pages of text do you 
think we could fit using these nanoscopic letters?
[04:46] Well, we could print all 7 Harry Potter books 
plus every book written by Stephen King,
[04:53] the entirety of the text from the English 
Wikipedia, and still have enough space to fit
[04:59] every single book from your local public library.
There’s an unbelievable quantity of nanoscopic
[05:06] lines and details that can fit into the area 
of a microchip, and it’s all photocopied by
[05:13] this EUV Lithography System in less than 
a second. It’s no exaggeration to say that
[05:19] every piece of modern technology that you use is 
made possible by this machine, and in this video,
[05:26] we’re going to explore the key modules inside it 
and see how they work. So, let’s jump right in.
[05:41] This video is sponsored by ASML, the company 
that designs and manufactures EUV Lithography
[05:48] Systems. Throughout the video all the details 
and facts were independently researched,
[05:54] written, and animated. Additionally some 
aspects are simplified, and due to the
[06:00] proprietary knowledge and confidentiality 
around EUV Lithography, some of the details
[06:05] we present are approximated or modified.
Before we open up and explore this EUV System,
[06:12] let’s first spend a few minutes discussing 
microchip manufacturing and semiconductor
[06:17] fabrication plants or fabs for short and 
the exact role of this machine. Inside our
[06:25] example fab are hundreds of machines 
of which a couple dozen or so are the   EUV Lithography machines we’ve been discussing.
To make a microchip, 300-millimeter silicon wafers
[06:37] are stacked inside a front-opening universal pod 
or foup and carried from machine to machine using
[06:44] an overhead transport system. The foup is lowered 
onto a machine where each wafer is processed in
[06:50] one way or another and, once the machine completes 
its work, the wafers are returned to the foup,
[06:57] the pod is picked up, carried to the next machine 
and dropped off for the next step in the process.
[07:04] Microchip manufacturing is incredibly complicated, 
but a simple way to think about it is that it’s
[07:11] kind of like spray painting a design through 
a stencil, but instead of art this stencil
[07:17] contains the nanoscopic patterns used to build 
the transistors and wires. Inside the microchip
[07:23] factory, some tools are used to build the stencil 
such as the EUV lithography system, and many
[07:29] of the other machines such as the deposition 
tools or ion implanters are the spray paint.
[07:36] So, let’s take a look at how we build the 
stencil on the wafer which is technically   called a photoresist layer. To begin, the wafer 
travels to a machine called a track tool where
[07:48] a light sensitive material called photoresist or 
just resist, is poured on and evenly spread across
[07:55] a spinning wafer. Next the wafer is heated in 
order to dry and solidify the resist thus forming
[08:03] a flat blank stencil. The wafer then moves to 
the photolithography tool where EUV or extreme
[08:11] ultraviolet light is projected onto 
the photomask, which is also called a   reticle but typically just a mask for short.
When EUV light hits the mask, the patterned
[08:21] information is imprinted in the light, and 
this imprinted light then bounces off a set
[08:26] of mirrored lenses in order to project a focused 
and scaled down image of the mask onto the wafer.
[08:33] Wherever the EUV light touches, the resist 
is modified and thus the design is copied
[08:39] from the mask onto the wafer. The wafer moves 
to the next position and the EUV patterning
[08:45] process repeats again until the entire wafer is 
filled with copies of the design from the mask.
[08:52] Next the wafer travels back to the track tool, 
where the modified resist is washed away using a
[08:58] developing solvent and the wafer is heated to form 
a hardened stencil or completed photoresist mask
[09:05] layer on the top of the wafer.
Now that the wafer is patterned,   the wafer travels to the other spray paint-like 
tools in the fab which are used to etch away the
[09:16] uncovered areas, implant dopants such as boron 
or phosphor, or deposit a layer of copper,
[09:23] tungsten, or other metals, thereby building 
a single layer of nanoscopic structures.
[09:30] Note that there are additional process 
steps that we’re not going to get into.
[09:35] Now that we have a basic understanding of how 
the stencil and spray paint like processes
[09:40] form a single layer, let’s zoom into a nanoscopic 
view inside a microchip where we can see how the
[09:48] transistors and wires are incredibly complicated 
3-dimensional structures. Each of these
[09:54] layers are built one after the other starting 
with the transistors at the bottom, moving up
[09:59] to the small wires, and then wider and wider metal 
layers further up. In essence, to build a complete
[10:07] microchip, the stencil and spray paint process is 
repeated over and over each time building only a
[10:14] single layer, and therefore it’s more effective 
to visualize these processes as a loop, where a
[10:21] single pass of the loop forms one layer using 
a single mask design in the lithography tool,
[10:27] and then another layer is built using an entirely 
different mask loaded in the machine. To complete
[10:33] a GPU chip like this one, the series of process 
steps or loops is repeated around 80 times
[10:41] resulting in around a thousand individual process 
steps and taking four or so months to complete.
[10:48] Let’s go back to the nanoscopic view of the 
microchip. Here we can see that the lower
[10:54] layers are incredibly tiny and 13 nanometer EUV 
light is used to build the pattern for these
[11:01] layers. However, the upper wires are substantially 
larger and are patterned using an entirely
[11:08] different machine called a DUV or Deep Ultra 
Violet Photolithography System which is also
[11:15] built by ASML and uses deep ultraviolet wavelength 
light. DUV lithography tools were introduced
[11:23] in the 2000s and are still incredibly advanced 
machines. Because DUV tools typically cost less
[11:32] than EUV machines, it’s more cost-effective 
to use EUV tools to pattern the transistors
[11:38] and so-called critical layers, and then use DUV 
tools to pattern the upper, wider, less-critical
[11:46] layers. Additionally, less advanced chips that 
don’t require the smallest transistors and wires
[11:53] may forgo using EUV lithography altogether 
and only use DUV wavelengths, such as 193,
[12:03] 248 or 365 nanometers As a result, cutting 
edge fabs typically utilize different types of
[12:14] lithography tools, and all these machines work 
as an intricate ecosystem to make a microchip.
[12:21] With the basics of microchip manufacturing 
covered, let’s open an EUV lithography system,
[12:27] explore the incredible science and engineering 
inside, and divide the system into its five key
[12:34] parts: The light source, the illuminator, 
the reticle handler and reticle stage,
[12:40] the projection optics, and finally the wafer 
handler and wafer stages. We’ll begin with the
[12:46] light source which produces the EUV light, 
but let’s first answer the question of why
[12:52] we even need to use Extreme Ultraviolet Light.
Well, a simple analogy is to think of the light
[12:58] used to project and copy the pattern from the 
photomask as the tip of a marker. And, as you’re
[13:05] probably familiar with markers, if you want to 
draw thin lines then you need a marker that also
[13:10] has a thin tip. You can do tricks like angling the 
marker, but if you want to draw lines that are 100
[13:17] times thinner, well then you need to switch pens 
and use a much smaller, fine tipped pen. Likewise,
[13:25] to copy designs with dimensions only around 
10 nanometers wide, we use 13 nanometer light,
[13:33] which is in the extreme ultraviolet light 
range of the electromagnetic spectrum.
[13:38] The more technical answer deals with the 
wavelike nature of light and what happens   when light hits these nanoscopic patterns 
inside the photomask. These patterns are
[13:48] made from nanoscopic EUV absorbing blockers on 
top of a surface that reflects EUV light. We’ll
[13:56] explore the photomask and how the system uses 
reflective lenses a little later in this video,
[14:01] but for now instead of using reflective optics, 
it’s easier to visualize the photomask as through
[14:08] beam optics in a setup similar to the well-known 
double slit experiment. However, instead of the
[14:14] double slit we’re showing light passing through 
a complicated pattern of nanoscopic slits that
[14:20] represents a small portion of the overall 
photomask. So, what happens when we use a
[14:26] wavelength of light that’s substantially 
larger than the 13 nanometer EUV light,
[14:32] such as this 450-nanometer blue light. Well, when 
this large wavelength light hits the pattern,
[14:40] the pattern is almost entirely lost. This is due 
to the width of the holes in the pattern being
[14:46] substantially smaller than the wavelength of light 
hitting it. This limit to the resolving power of
[14:52] the lithography machine is described in Rayleigh’s 
Criterion Equation, which we will explain later.
[15:00] So, let’s switch to 13 nanometer EUV light. 
As the EUV light hits the pattern, the light
[15:07] passes through and the pattern of the photomask is 
imprinted into the light, and the light diffracts
[15:13] similar to the double slit experiment. This 
imprinted light then passes into projection optics
[15:20] mirrored lenses which are used to focus and scale 
down the pattern and project it onto the wafer.
[15:26] So now that we understand the need for EUV 
light, the next question is how do we produce
[15:32] it? To start, two high-powered laser pulses run 
through multiple amplifiers below the cleanroom
[15:39] floor. These laser pulses grow in power and then 
travel from the sub-fab using a pathway of mirrors
[15:47] and up through the bottom of the tool and into a 
chamber called the source vessel. The first laser,
[15:53] called the pre-pulse, is around 5 kilowatts 
in power and is targeted at a droplet of tin
[15:59] using a set of actuated mirrors. This pre-pulse 
laser turns the tin droplets into a pancake-like
[16:07] shape. The second approximately 25-kilowatt main 
laser pulse which is more than 10 times stronger
[16:14] than the lasers used to cut steel, hits the tin 
pancake, instantly vaporizing it and turning it
[16:21] into glowing plasma. Within each of the tin atoms, 
some electrons are ejected, and others are kicked
[16:28] up to higher energy states. When electrons 
drop back down from the 4F to 4D orbitals,
[16:35] 13-nanometer EUV light is produced. Shooting two 
laser pulses at a droplet of tin might seem like a
[16:44] rather obscure process, however EUV light doesn’t 
naturally occur on Earth and it’s one of the few
[16:51] ways to efficiently produce over 500 Watts of 
EUV Light. Additionally, the reason for using
[16:58] tin is that its plasma produces a wide range of 
wavelengths with a clear peak at 13 nanometers.
[17:06] So, where does the tin droplet come from? Well 
over here a solid ingot of ultra-pure tin is
[17:13] melted and fed into a storage tank and then piped 
towards a microscopic nozzle. A piezo electric
[17:20] transducer squeezes the tip of the nozzle, and due 
to high-pressure nitrogen inside the storage tank,
[17:28] a droplet of tin is forced out at a 
speed of 100 meters a second. Next,
[17:33] high speed cameras measure and calculate the 
trajectory of the droplet and feed the data to
[17:39] a set of actuated mirrors in order to angle 
the laser pulses to precisely hit the tin.
[17:46] To control the amount of EUV light, sometimes 
droplets are skipped by the lasers, and these
[17:52] droplets are captured over here. This process 
of producing high speed tin droplets and then
[17:59] shooting them with 2 laser pulses to generate EUV 
light happens at a rate of 50,000 times a second.
[18:07] Now that we have EUV light, the first mirror 
called the collector, focuses all the EUV
[18:13] light to a small hole called the intermediate 
focus, which only EUV light can pass through.
[18:20] The light next enters into the illuminator, 
which is composed of the field facet mirror,
[18:26] the pupil facet mirror, and another set of 
mirrors. These mirrors are so perfectly shaped
[18:32] that there’s less than an atom’s deviation from 
the surface. The illuminator takes this EUV light
[18:39] and shapes it into a thin ribbon that has equal 
uniformity across a well-defined range of angles
[18:46] before it hits the photomask. Using an equal 
uniformity of light at all angles is critical to
[18:53] imprinting a perfect nanoscopic pattern from 
the mask via the light and onto the wafer.
[18:59] We want to take a short detour and mention that 
this has been a rather challenging video to make
[19:05] simply because there’s a mountain of science 
and engineering inside these machines built   by ASML and this video only explores the tip of 
the iceberg. Essentially, a lot of the details
[19:17] had to be cut in order to keep this video a 
manageable length. For example, EUV light is
[19:24] incredibly difficult to work with because it’s 
absorbed by atmospheric molecules, and therefore
[19:30] the entire light path and wafer carrier stage is 
connected to vacuum pumps, which remove all the
[19:36] air. Additionally, EUV light is absorbed by glass 
and practically all other materials, and therefore
[19:43] to focus and transport the light, this system 
uses mirrors rather than transmissive lenses.
[19:50] However, these mirrors called Bragg Reflectors, 
are nothing like the mirrors in your bathroom,
[19:57] but rather they’re composed of dozens of 
alternating layers of silicon and molybdenum,
[20:02] each only a few nanometers thick. When EUV 
light hits the surface of this Bragg Reflector,
[20:09] only 3% is reflected at each boundary layer while 
the rest passes through. But with so many layers
[20:17] the cumulative 3% reflections add together using 
constructive interference, resulting in a total
[20:24] of 70% being reflected for a single mirror, while 
30% of the light is lost and absorbed. However,
[20:31] with more than 10 mirrors in the optical system, 
and only 70% reflection at each one, the final
[20:38] light hitting the wafer is less than 10 percent 
the brightness of the light emitted by the tin
[20:43] plasma, which is why the initial light from the 
source vessel needs to be as bright as possible.
[20:50] Another example of the incredible engineering 
inside this machine is that this field facet
[20:56] mirror is assembled from hundreds of independently 
controlled mirrors that can be angled to direct
[21:02] the light onto specific regions of the segmented 
pupil facet mirror. Together, these two mirrors
[21:09] take the cone of EUV light from the intermediate 
focus and turn it into a complex pattern of
[21:16] illumination. For example, this is called annular 
illumination, here’s dipole illumination and
[21:23] then here’s quasar illumination. You’re probably 
wondering why we require such complicated patterns
[21:30] of illumination. Well, when we look back at the 
microchip, one layer of wires is running mostly
[21:36] horizontally, the next layer is a set of cylinders 
called vias, and then the following layers have
[21:43] wires that run vertically, and each layer uses 
a different mask. Earlier we said that the EUV
[21:50] light is kind of like the tip of a fine tipped 
pen. Having different patterns of illumination is
[21:56] like holding the marker at different angles with 
respect to the lines or circles that are being
[22:02] patterned. Specifically, annular illumination is 
best used to pattern the layers containing vias
[22:09] and is like holding the marker straight up and 
down, whereas dipole illumination like this is
[22:16] best used to pattern lines running horizontally, 
and then we rotate the dipole illumination for
[22:22] patterning the vertically oriented wires.
Imagine being at the forefront of this
[22:28] groundbreaking science and engineering. Then 
picture ASML, whose work powers the innovations
[22:35] that solve some of humanity's toughest challenges 
in energy, mobility, and healthcare. ASML is a

[23:52] learn more and start a journey with ASML today.
Let’s move onto the next part of this EUV
[24:00] Lithography tool and explore the photomask 
or mask which is also called a reticle and
[24:07] contains the entire design of a single layer of a 
microchip. The mask starts in a doubly sealed pod
[24:14] and is loaded onto the machine using an overhead 
transport system. The outer protective carrier is
[24:20] opened, and a robotic arm picks up the inner pod 
and carries it to a vacuum load lock. The chamber
[24:27] is sealed and pumped down to a vacuum, and the 
inner door opens. Next the inner pod opens up and
[24:34] a separate robotic arm carries the mask and base 
to an inspection station. Each mask has half a
[24:41] dozen different marks including a bar code as well 
as fiducials, which are designs used to align the
[24:48] mask with sub-nanometer level accuracy. The mask 
is carried over to and loaded onto the reticle
[24:55] stage which moves back and forth across the EUV 
beam with incredible accuracy and at high speeds
[25:02] with more than 7Gs of acceleration. This mask’s 
surface is built from the same Bragg reflector
[25:09] surface mentioned earlier but with a pattern of 
absorbers on top that locally blocks the light in
[25:16] order to create the detailed microchip layer 
pattern. This 6 by 6-inch mask has a pattern
[25:22] area of 104 by 132 millimeters and an absorber 
pixel resolution of below 10 by 10 nanometers.
[25:32] In the beginning of this video we showed a 
variety of different chips with different sizes,
[25:38] and shortly after we showed a GPU being 
patterned across the wafer. The pattern
[25:43] on the mask is 4 times larger than the microchip 
and this GPU chip is close to the maximum size
[25:51] chip that can fit on the mask, and therefore 
only one copy fits, resulting in 90 GPU chips
[25:58] fitting onto a 300-millimeter wafer. However, 
CPU Chips are typically smaller and therefore,
[26:06] in the following example, we can fit 2 copies 
on the mask and a total of 185 chips on the
[26:13] wafer. When we look at even smaller DRAM chips, 
12 copies can fit on the mask, yielding 978 chips
[26:22] on the wafer. Technically, the exposure field 
is one scan of the mask onto the wafer, and an
[26:29] exposure field can have anywhere from 1 to a dozen 
or more die patterns on it, yielding around a 100
[26:35] to a thousand or more chips on a single wafer.
This mask contains an incredible amount of
[26:41] information and, as mentioned in the intro, it 
has the equivalent amount of detail as all the
[26:47] text of Wikipedia plus all the books in an average 
public library. This mask, which can cost around
[26:54] 300,000 dollars, must be so perfect that using 
our analogy there can’t be a single grammatical
[27:02] error, spelling mistake, or even an extra curve 
on a letter across 21 million pages of text,
[27:10] otherwise it would damage every chip on the wafer. 
Also, if you’re curious, here are the calculations
[27:17] we used for the transistors to text and book 
conversions. Pause the video to work it out.
[27:24] The next topics we’ll explore are the 
projection optics and how the wafer is   moved around the machine. But first we’d like 
to mention that this video topic is incredibly
[27:35] complicated and took hundreds of hours to 
research, write, model, animate, and edit,
[27:42] totaling over 1100 hours. So, if you could take

[27:50] comment with a quick message below, and most 
importantly, share it on social media and with
[27:55] a friend, family, or work colleague, it would help 
far more than you think! Additionally, we have a
[28:02] Patreon page with AMAs and behind the scenes 
footage, and, if you find what we do useful,
[28:09] we would appreciate any support. Thank you.
So, let’s move on to the projection optics.
[28:17] These optics are composed of a series of mirrors 
that are used to project and focus the patterned
[28:23] EUV light onto the wafer with extremely high 
accuracy, while minimizing wavefront aberrations,
[28:30] and shrinking the image by a factor of 4. These 
mirrors are designed and manufactured by Zeiss,
[28:37] who is a longstanding partner of ASML and has 
been a vital collaborator in the development of
[28:43] the optics systems inside photolithography tools. 
To understand the projection optics, we have to
[28:50] discuss what determines exactly how small these 
wires can be, and for this Rayleigh’s Criterion
[28:57] Equation is used. This equation states that 
the smallest dimension or critical dimension,
[29:03] is equal to k1 times the wavelength of light or 
Lamda divided by the numerical aperture, or NA.
[29:11] The wavelength of EUV light is 13 nanometers. 
K1 is the process factor, which relates to the
[29:19] various illumination settings created by the field 
and pupil facet mirrors that we discussed earlier,
[29:26] along with the photoresist, and other factors 
and is close to .3 for this machine. Finally,
[29:33] numerical aperture or NA is a measure of the angle 
and amount of light the mirrors in the projection
[29:39] optics can capture and focus onto the wafer. 
Numerical aperture isn’t just about increasing
[29:45] the brightness of the EUV light, but rather it’s 
more of a measure of the angles and amount of
[29:52] constructive interference wave paths that hit the 
mask, and then are projected onto the wafer. In
[29:59] short, with a larger numerical aperture or NA, 
which corresponds to a larger angle between the
[30:05] projection mirrors and focal point, we can achieve 
a smaller resolution. This tool has a numerical
[30:12] aperture of 0.33, however the next generation of 
EUV lithography systems called high NA, increases
[30:21] this to 0.55 resulting in an 8-nanometer critical 
dimension. Increasing the numerical aperture to
[30:30] 0.55 requires significantly larger mirrors which 
results in a redesign of the entire optics system
[30:38] and other parts of the machine, thus considerably 
increasing the size and cost of the system.
[30:47] We could spend an entire video discussing 
the next generation High NA tool,
[30:52] but instead let’s move on to discuss the wafer 
transport system and wafer stage and see how a
[30:59] wafer makes its way to the EUV exposure station.
Let’s start with a wafer that’s carried in a foup
[31:06] on the overhead transport system. This foup lands 
on the lithography cluster, which is a combination
[31:13] of a wafer track tool and a lithography tool. 
The wafer first enters the track tool where a
[31:20] layer of photoresist or resist for short, is 
evenly spread across the wafer. The wafer moves
[31:27] to another area inside the track tool where it’s 
heated in order to dry and solidify the resist.
[31:34] Next, using robotic arms the wafer is carried 
from the track tool into a vacuum load lock
[31:41] inside the EUV tool. The pneumatically actuated 
doors close and the chamber is pumped down to a
[31:49] vacuum. Next the back doors of the load 
lock open up and a different robotic arm
[31:54] carries the wafer to one of the wafer stages.
This system is called a TWINSCAN because there
[32:01] are two complete wafer stages that concurrently 
move two wafers around. The key idea is that
[32:08] while one wafer is actively being patterned, 
a second wafer is being loaded onto the wafer
[32:13] stage and measured under an alignment sensor.
Nanometer level accuracy is crucial with these
[32:20] machines and one key philosophy of ASML 
is “Meten is Weten” which is Dutch for
[32:27] “To Measure Something is to Know something”. The 
reason for requiring this level of perfection is
[32:33] that when we look at the nanoscopic layers of 
the microchip, which has wires and holes that
[32:39] are only 10 to 20 nanometers wide, if one layer 
is more than a couple nanometers off the previous
[32:45] layer, then the electrical connections won’t 
conduct electricity correctly, and if an entire
[32:51] layer is off, then every single chip 
will be catastrophically destroyed.
[32:57] To make sure that the layer being patterned 
is perfectly aligned with the previous layer,
[33:02] the entire wafer is thoroughly measured by the 
alignment sensor. On the wafer are hundreds of
[33:09] alignment marks, which are reference patterns 
that assist in determining the exact position
[33:14] of the earlier layers of patterns. The alignment 
sensor meticulously measures the X and Y positions
[33:22] of every alignment mark on the wafer and builds a 
highly accurate 2D map from the results. This map
[33:30] shows some regions of the wafer being biased in 
one direction by a few to dozens of nanometers,
[33:36] and another region being biased in a different 
direction. Additionally, the leveling sensor
[33:42] uses grazing incident light to measure the exact 
height of the wafer and builds a topological map
[33:49] of the wafer which is critical for later bringing 
the wafer stage to the position such that the EUV
[33:56] light is perfectly focused onto the wafer.
Now that we’ve measured and built the exact
[34:02] alignment and height map for the wafer, the wafer 
stage next moves to the EUV exposure station.
[34:09] As the wafer is being patterned, the wafer stage 
moves in perfect synchrony with the reticle stage,
[34:16] but only a quarter of the distance due to 
the 4 to 1 reduction. At the same time,
[34:22] the stage makes nano-scale adjustments using the 
alignment map so that the new layer perfectly
[34:28] aligns with the previous layer. When the wafer 
stage moves from one exposure field to the next,
[34:35] it’s important that no EUV light hits the 
wafer, and thus a shutter positioned up here,
[34:42] near the reticle stage closes. Once the wafer 
stage is positioned to pattern the next microchip,
[34:49] the shutter opens and the wafer stage and 
reticle stage move in perfect synchrony again.
[34:55] This process repeats until the entire wafer is 
patterned taking around 18 seconds in total.
[35:03] So then, what actually happens as EUV light hits 
the photoresist? Well, resist is a polymer mixed
[35:12] with a Photo Acid Generator. When high energy 
EUV photons hit the resist, the light ionizes it
[35:19] releasing high energy electrons. These electrons 
then hit the photo acid generator producing
[35:25] an acid that breaks apart the polymer making 
it weaker. As a result, the areas hit by the
[35:32] EUV light become soluble and are washed away by a 
developing liquid in the subsequent process step.
[35:40] One detail is that the resist has an extremely 
high contrast, meaning that at a certain level
[35:46] of EUV light, the entirety of the resist hit by 
that light is broken down. This is critical in
[35:54] producing sharp patterns and walls on the resist.
Let’s next explore how the wafer and wafer stage
[36:01] move around. Specifically, the wafer stages 
levitate on a large magnetic table composed of
[36:08] more than a thousand magnets. Electromagnets 
on the underside of the wafer stage move it
[36:14] along this magnetic table both quickly and with 
micrometer level accuracy while interferometers
[36:20] on the top of the stage measure its exact position 
and this setup is called the long-stroke stage.
[36:27] In order to secure the wafer, it’s placed 
on a plate which is technically called an
[36:32] electrostatic clamp. The clamp cycles zones of 
high voltage across the backside of the wafer
[36:39] to keep it in place, a phenomenon similar 
to sticking a ballon to a wall using static
[36:44] electricity. To reach nanometer level accuracy 
the plate is independently moved using smaller
[36:52] motors which is called the short-stroke stage.
By combining the long stroke and short stroke
[36:58] stages along with measurement encoders, the 
machine can quickly move the wafer as it’s
[37:04] being patterned and maintain an accuracy of less 
than 1 nanometer or approximately 4 silicon atoms.
[37:12] Once all the microchip patterns are copied to the 
wafer, the stage moves back towards the robotic
[37:18] arms where the wafer is unloaded and placed 
into one of the vacuum load locks, pumped back
[37:24] to atmosphere, and then a separate robotic arm 
brings the wafer back to the track tool, where the
[37:30] patterned and modified resist is washed away using 
a developing liquid. Finally, the wafer is heated
[37:37] again to further harden the remaining resist. The 
patterned wafer is then loaded back into the foup
[37:44] which is picked up and brought to a different 
tool to undergo processing in other ways.
[37:50] Let’s close this tool and that’s it for 
our journey into photolithography. If
