Video YESrXVkcCHY
======================================================================

[00:00] I have gone over a lot of AI tools on this channel.
[00:03] I've made probably 30 plus videos at this point
covering those various tools.
[00:08] So in this video
I want to talk to you about which ones
[00:11] I actually use on a day by day basis as a developer,
[00:15] what tools are open on my computer
and are getting the most use, stick around.
[00:20] I'm going to go through a bunch of them,
[00:21] and you're probably going to learn about
some new ones that you've never seen before.
[00:24] So let's start with some of the obvious ones.
[00:27] I have cursor and windsurf.
[00:29] Now cursor is typically my go to IDE,
especially if I'm working on something
[00:34] that is a hybrid projects, or as a back end,
a front end and a lot of different components.
[00:39] Then I have windsurf,
which is another editor that I use.
[00:42] I was using windsurf a lot when it first came out,
because I found that
[00:46] it did actually perform better than cursor,
but now cursor has just accelerated extremely fast.
[00:52] And to be honest,
[00:52] I mostly use cursor on a day by day basis
because I find that now it is better than windsurf.
[00:58] Again, these things change.
[00:59] Maybe windsurf will come up with an update
and then I'll start using it again.
[01:03] At the beginning
I had a bunch of features that cursor didn't have,
[01:06] and then cursor pretty much copied all of them
and added them to the IDE, and that's how it is now.
[01:10] If you want to turn on these tools
and you're not sure what they are, essentially
[01:14] they are AI IDEs, which means
you can go in this window and do something like, hey,
[01:19] you know, change the title of my website,
you can pick your model.
[01:23] In this case I'm using GPT five.
[01:25] And then I'm just going to go ahead
and start actually writing code for you,
[01:29] making changes and then allowing you to view
those changes inside of the editor.
[01:33] Now, because I am a real developer,
I still like to have control of the code.
[01:37] I like to modify things myself,
move around the files, and I'm very comfortable
[01:41] in these type of editors.
[01:42] So that's why I prefer to use this
most of the time when I'm developing.
[01:46] However, there are a lot of other
AI tools that aren't for Ides,
[01:50] and I'm going to talk about later in this video.
[01:52] Now, the next two on my list is by far
the one that I use the most, and that is ChatGPT.
[01:58] Pretty straightforward.
[01:59] I'm sure all of you use this,
[02:00] but I want to explain to you what I use it for
and why it gets the most amount of use.
[02:05] Now I use ChatGPT for pretty much everything,
whether it's writing emails, responding
[02:10] to queries, reviewing contracts,
helping me manage dev, launch students,
[02:14] reviewing resumes, just building in a lot of context,
and getting really accurate replies.
[02:20] It helps me script videos.
[02:22] It helps me do accounting things.
[02:23] It helps me answer random questions
like I'll take a photo of,
[02:26] you know, something in my bedroom
or something and be like, what is this thing?
[02:30] Why is this wall outlet look like this?
[02:32] You guys get the idea.
[02:34] But the thing is,
because I've been using ChatGPT for so long,
[02:38] like since it came out, it knows everything about me.
[02:41] It knows what car I drive, it knows where I travel.
[02:44] It knows the plans that I have because I feed it
all of this information, which is probably not
[02:49] a good thing security wise, but it happens anyways,
so I might as well take advantage of it.
[02:53] So when I go to ChatGPT and I ask it something,
it has such relevant context
[02:58] that a lot of these other
AI tools just simply cannot have,
[03:01] because I haven't been using them for two,
three, four plus years.
[03:04] So because of all of that context, it's something
that I stick with pretty much every single day.
[03:09] And even though it's not as good
as a lot of the other tools at specific tasks,
[03:13] it's just my go to tool.
[03:14] I use it on my phone,
I use it on the computer, and I have it open
[03:18] multiple hours per day,
almost always in a second monitor.
[03:21] That's why and how I use it.
[03:23] Let's move on to the next one.
[03:24] Now, the next tool on my list
has been a total game changer
[03:28] for my coding productivity
and just productivity in general.
[03:31] And that's whisper flow.
[03:33] Now this is hands down the faster
and most accurate dictation tool that I've ever used.
[03:38] It runs in the background, and with a quick keyboard
shortcut, you can start dictating in real time.
[03:43] Now I use it on windows, Mac, and even on my iPhone
because it has like an iOS keyboard extension.
[03:48] And unlike the built in voice modes or the OS level,
[03:51] dictation flow works in any application.
[03:55] It's quicker, more accurate,
and even saves the history of all of the dictations,
[03:59] which I find extremely useful
so that I don't lose long prompts that I'm speaking.
[04:03] And for me,
this is legitimately three times my productivity.
[04:07] Now I can normally type honestly,
probably around 6070 words per minute.
[04:11] I'm not a great typer, but with flow I can stream
my thoughts at almost 200 words per minute.
[04:17] I'll show you the tool here.
[04:18] You can see I think it's like 190
is my average of words per minute in the tool.
[04:22] And that means that my
AI prompts are way more detailed
[04:25] and contextual without me having to slow down.
[04:28] Now I use this everywhere.
[04:29] So cursor Windsor, lovable ChatGPT, WhatsApp,
discord, literally everything.
[04:33] I'm just always speaking into my computer
now, especially when I want to write longer messages.
[04:38] And there's something new
that's in this tool as well.
[04:40] In cursor and windsurf flow
can actually tag variables and files as you dictate.
[04:46] So rather than the normal voice mode,
which is pretty much just giving you
[04:49] text in the editor,
this knows what application you're working inside of.
[04:53] And then it can actually tag individual files
and use the built in features in that tool,
[04:58] which is very useful
for providing the right context for the AI.
[05:02] Now, flow also has extras like a custom vocabulary,
built in notes, team sharing.
[05:06] But honestly, the biggest thing is that it just works
every single time I want to use it.
[05:11] And honestly, if you're not using voice right now,
you're missing out on massive productivity gains.
[05:15] And more importantly, you're probably not providing
the best prompts that you could be to your AI models.
[05:21] I know for me, when I speak,
I always give more detail
[05:23] because I'm just not as lazy
as if I have to type it out.
[05:26] Now, full disclosure
[05:27] I was able to partner with Flo on this video,
but I've been using them well before the partnership.
[05:31] I've been using them for months now
[05:33] and if you guys want to try it out for free,
you can do so from the link in the description.
[05:37] And I'm going to be going over
a full tutorial of this tool soon.
[05:40] Now the next item on my list is Deep
Agent by Abacus AI.
[05:45] Now this is something that I use whenever
I need really complex, long running agent tasks
[05:50] where I can go out, search the internet, build
an app, generate a PowerPoint, make a document, etc.
[05:56] there's a lot of use cases.
[05:57] I made a lot of videos on this on the channel,
so I'm not going to dive extremely in-depth.
[06:01] But just to quickly show you a few things,
I've got this to do for me.
[06:03] I moved into a new apartment recently,
so I got to do the full interior design
[06:07] for that apartment based on the floor plan
and kind of the preferences that I sent to it.
[06:12] I got it to build a full application
[06:15] that actually is a roadmap tracker
for my dev launch students.
[06:18] So I'm not going to run through the whole app.
[06:19] But essentially it's like a custom platform
that I can use to generate a roadmap
[06:24] that I can give to students.
[06:25] And then I gave it a bunch of other tasks.
[06:27] One notable one is that, again,
I moved into this apartment
[06:30] and I noticed there's a lot of construction
around me, so I wanted to see, okay,
[06:34] how long are these buildings
going to take to be built?
[06:36] You know, how tall are they going to be?
[06:38] Are they going to block my view
or are they going to be noisy?
[06:40] So I just told deep agent, hey, this is my address.
[06:43] This is the apartment. This is the floor that I'm on.
[06:45] You know what?
[06:46] Buildings are near me
that are going to be built soon.
[06:48] Give me the timeline.
[06:49] Give me the floors,
tell me if it's going to block my view, etc..
[06:52] Again.
[06:53] Took a very long time, ran and was able
to actually do that with very high accuracy,
[06:57] which I'm
not able to really do with something like ChatGPT.
[07:01] I'm sure there's other AI tools
that can do this as well, but my experience is deep.
[07:04] It works really well for these very complex tasks,
so that's what I use it for.
[07:08] Now the next tool on my list is warp.
[07:11] This is essentially an AI terminal.
[07:13] I mean they're branding
and it's like an a genetic AI editor,
[07:16] but really it's a terminal
with a bunch of AI inside of it.
[07:19] And this allows you to actually generate code
as well as run commands.
[07:24] And it's really good for automation tasks or whenever
you don't want to really dive into the code.
[07:28] And you more so want to work purely
kind of on the back end without a ton of visuals
[07:32] and be automating a lot of stuff.
[07:34] So recently
I made a full discord bot, for example, using this
[07:37] because there's a lot of deployment,
a lot of configuration, containerization, etc.
[07:41] that you need to do.
[07:42] So it works really well in this terminal environment
where you can just switch it to a normal terminal
[07:47] and you can like run a command,
and then you can like open
[07:49] a file directly inside of here
if you want to look at it.
[07:52] Or I can switch it to agent mode
and I can say, you know,
[07:55] tell me what files are here
[07:58] and then it will determine the commands
and the task that it should actually run.
[08:02] Something interesting about this
is that you can run agents in parallel.
[08:05] So I can open up a new tab here and say, hey,
how are you or something.
[08:09] Right.
[08:10] And now both of these are running
actually at the exact same time
[08:13] or while this one's already finished,
but you can run multiple of them at the same time.
[08:16] Kind of like multithreaded agents,
which I find is cool.
[08:19] And again, it's what I like
for kind of the terminal based AI editing.
[08:23] It's not the only thing that I use.
[08:25] Like I said, I still use cursor,
I still use windsurf, I use a lot of the other tools,
[08:29] but I'm working more in a deployment
or a back end environment.
[08:32] Then I'll open up warp
and I'll use it as an agent like kind of terminal
[08:35] where it can suggest commands for me, especially
for like containerization, Kubernetes, etc.
[08:40] and it's quite useful.
[08:41] Now the next tool that I use is lovable.
[08:44] Now this is only what I use
when I want to generate simple frontends.
[08:48] I do not build entire
full stack applications with lovable.
[08:52] Even though you can't do that,
I simply use it for like landing
[08:55] pages, basic design,
or spinning up relatively simple sites.
[09:00] Now, you guys might have seen recently
that I actually launched my dev launch vault.
[09:03] vault.devlaunch.us is the URL
if you want to check it out,
[09:07] and I use lovable to actually generate
the entire landing page for that.
[09:10] Then I brought it into Curser
[09:12] and I made a few adjustments so you can see,
like I'm inside of the lovable editor right now.
[09:16] You can see
there is a bunch of prompts that I went through,
[09:18] and eventually I got it to create
what I think is a really slick, simple website
[09:22] just to promote, again,
this kind of new product that we're launching,
[09:25] which is a simple course for the people
that can't afford dev launch, essentially.
[09:29] I'm genuinely not trying to sell to you.
[09:30] I'm just trying to show you
that I use lovable to do that.
[09:33] I got it to generate, like the privacy page,
the disclaimer,
[09:36] the company info, and I've used it
for some other simple websites as well.
[09:40] Again, typically
when it's a few pages, it's relatively basic.
[09:44] It doesn't have a ton of data or backend.
[09:46] And then what I do is once it starts getting a bit
more complicated, I take the code from GitHub,
[09:51] I put it into Curser, and then I do
the rest of the serious development work.
[09:55] Lovable is really good
for those simple design things.
[09:58] Again, I don't think it's the best
for like really complex applications,
[10:01] which is why I don't use it for that,
but for quick landing pages.
[10:04] As you can see,
I've made a few here. It's pretty good.
[10:07] The next item on my list is one that I genuinely
cannot live without, and that is HTML Divi.
[10:13] Now, this is essentially a meeting recorder
[10:16] where any time I join
any kind of Google Meet or Zoom or whatever,
[10:20] this AI bot
automatically joins from me and records the meeting.
[10:24] Now, it doesn't just do that, obviously,
it generates the AI summary and notes.
[10:27] It also allows me to provide a template
so that based on the meeting type
[10:31] that I'm having,
I can have notes based on that template.
[10:34] And then it gives me the full transcript.
[10:36] And oftentimes
what I end up doing is copying the transcript
[10:39] into another tool like ChatGPT,
and then having it analyze that for me
[10:44] so that I can get kind of immediate answers
and use that for, for example,
[10:48] crafting a video or coming up with a roadmap
or helping a student or whatever.
[10:52] Now it has automations built in.
[10:53] So I'm able to connect this with Zapier, for example.
[10:55] So anytime a meeting is finished,
[10:57] it automatically does a zap or whatever,
and then it sends that recording to discord.
[11:02] So my other team members can view it and I have
I just use this all the time.
[11:06] I literally use it multiple times per day.
[11:07] It connects to all of my meetings.
[11:09] I know there's a lot of AI kind of recorders
out there, but for me this one works extremely well.
[11:14] They've never sponsor my channel.
[11:15] I'm just mentioning it because like,
this is what I genuinely use
[11:18] and that's the part of the video
or that's the point of the video.
[11:20] This next tool is one that I've been
using more recently, and this is called blitzes.
[11:25] Now this tool is significantly different
than a lot of the other
[11:28] AI tools that you've used before,
because it emphasizes spending a lot of time
[11:32] writing a prompt and understanding
the context of the project before it does any work.
[11:37] So rather than running in a few minutes or an hour,
this tool
[11:40] typically takes 1 to 3 days
to actually come up with a response.
[11:44] And it's specifically designed
for software development.
[11:47] So let me show you a quick example.
[11:49] Essentially what will happen with Blitzy.
[11:51] You'll upload your existing code base.
[11:52] In my case, I uploaded my previous startup code base,
which was quite large.
[11:56] It will generate a massive like 200
plus page technical doc
[12:01] with all of the information, all of the architecture,
all of the flowcharts and diagrams you can see.
[12:07] Like it just generates a massive amount of context
and really understands the project deeply.
[12:12] And then you can press one of these buttons here
and you can like add
[12:15] a feature or refactor
the code base or whatever you want to do.
[12:18] But when you do that, you're expected
to write a very detailed prompt or instruction,
[12:24] essentially what you would pass
like a junior developer, and then it will go away
[12:29] and essentially start executing that task
and take about five minutes per file to run.
[12:34] So I've done tasks here that took four days.
[12:36] I've done tasks that took eight hours, nine hours.
[12:39] But it's very, very comprehensive.
[12:41] And I've had it generate over 200,000 lines of code.
[12:44] Even though they promote
that it can generate over 3 million.
[12:48] So just an interesting tool,
something worth checking out.
[12:50] And I've been using a recently,
especially because these kind of context documents
[12:54] are just extremely interesting to look through.
[12:56] Next tool on my list is Zapier.
[12:58] Those isn't really an AI tool,
but I figured I'd mention it because it connects
[13:02] to a lot of my AI tools.
[13:04] Now, this is essentially something that you can use
to build visual flows
[13:08] and run all kinds of automations
based on triggers or events.
[13:12] So in this case,
I was talking to you about the TV meeting recorded
[13:16] and then like sending a message in discord.
[13:18] So I have this hooked up to my TV.
[13:20] I have these filter conditions
like make sure this is a dev
[13:23] launch strategy, call, for example,
because that's the one I want to run this automation
[13:26] on, and then send a message in the channel
where it says,
[13:29] hey, like this meeting was finished or completed,
this was the date, this is who it's with.
[13:34] You know, you can watch the meeting here.
[13:36] And then I have another message
I can't show you because it has some sensitive data,
[13:39] but it sends me a direct message
[13:40] with essentially information that I need in order
to proceed to the next step with the student.
[13:45] So Zapier. Super cool.
[13:46] I have like 100 plus zaps in here.
[13:48] Again, they're kind of confidential, so I can't
show them all to you, but something I use a lot.
[13:53] All right, so that is a pretty detailed list
of most of the AI tools that I actually use.
[13:57] Now, in terms of frameworks,
I use a lot of AI frameworks to build
[14:01] AI agents and build my own AI tools,
and I'm going to quickly go through them.
[14:05] Now. I pretty much always use Python, and then I use
lang chain lang graph and then I have some notes.
[14:11] So let me look at the side of my screen.
[14:13] I use live kit.
[14:14] This is for like voice agents I use VPI.
[14:16] Same thing for voice agents
depending on the type of ones I'm trying to build.
[14:20] I use deep gram, another one for voice agents,
and then I use all kinds of other tools like ingest,
[14:25] for example, for AI orchestration, and probably
a bunch of other ones that I'm forgetting.
[14:29] But those are the main frameworks.
[14:31] And typically I'm working with Lang Chain
or lang graph and then connecting it up to something
[14:35] like a chroma DB database and some other various
kind of like helper modules and libraries.
[14:41] There are so many AI tools out there,
I use a lot of them, but these are
[14:44] the ones that came to the top of my head
when I was thinking of crafting this video.
[14:48] Hopefully you found it useful.
[14:50] You learned about an AI tool
[14:51] that maybe you've never seen before,
and now you're going to go play around with it
[14:54] and kind of have some more productivity
or some more usefulness.
[14:57] I don't know from these tools.
[14:58] Anyways, if you guys enjoyed the video,
[15:00] make sure leave a like subscribe
and I will see you in the next one.
