How We Catch a Year’s Worth of Food in a Single Day: Munkha Ice Fishing in Yakutia
======================================================================

[00:00] It's November now. Arian and his family 
are getting ready to go traditional ice
[00:05] fishing known as Munkha. Munkha takes 
place every November, marking the final
[00:11] days before Yakutia's long and brutally cold 
winter begins. It's only -15°C today. Yet,
[00:18] Arian and his family will spend the entire day 
outside. They dress in layers, making sure to
[00:24] stay warm because once they reach the frozen lake, 
there is no coming back until the job is done.
[01:04] Today is a big day for the whole village. 
It's the day when the locals hope to catch
[01:09] several tons of crucial carp, enough to feed 
families through the long winter months ahead.
[01:20] Before fishing begins, the leader and 
most experienced fisherman performs an
[01:25] ancient ritual, feeding the spirits 
of the forest, waters, and hunters.
[01:36] In Yakutia, surviving the winter has always 
been a team effort. That's how fishing was born.
[01:42] A traditional and ingenious form of 
ice fishing passed down from father
[01:47] to son for thousands of years. 
Before Munkha fishing begins,
[01:52] an elder of the village carefully chooses 
which lake will be fished this year. This
[01:57] decision is never random. It's made with deep 
respect for nature and the local ecosystem.
[02:11] Teams of about 10 people gather, each with a 
specific role. The strongest men cut two large
[02:17] holes in the thick ice where they will 
place a V-shaped net about 100 m long.
[02:28] Then they drill a series of smaller holes 
between them to guide the net underneath
[02:33] the ice using long wooden sticks with 
hooks. Slowly, the net is pulled from
[02:38] one side of the lake to the other until 
it covers nearly the entire perimeter.
[02:54] In Munkha fishing, there is one 
important rule. No one should
[02:57] stand without work. Not even a child or a 
woman. Everyone takes part in their own way.
[03:12] Over the years, Mona has become more than just 
fishing. It's a true festival. People laugh,
[03:18] talk, and enjoy the last relatively 
warm day before the deep cold sets
[03:23] in. Children play outside. The boys are 
wrestling, the national sport of Yakutia,
[03:29] and a big part of the culture. In Yakutia, 
every boy wants to become a strong wrestler.
[03:47] Now it's time to eat. Today's menu 
is nutritious soup with fresh meat
[03:52] and potato. Eating often is essential to 
keep up energy in the harsh Arctic cold.
[04:30] After the meal, everyone gathers around as the 
elders speak to the younger generation. In Yakut
[04:36] culture, respect for elders runs deep. Their 
words carry wisdom and tradition. The young
[04:42] boys listen quietly, learning not only about 
fishing, but about life, work, and strength.
[04:59] There are also sacred rules. Those who have 
attended a funeral within 40 days or pregnant
[05:05] women are not allowed to join the fishing. Locals 
believe that the lake can sense the intense energy
[05:11] and therefore will not give its gifts. Arian's 
father, Kirill, prepares long wooden sticks for
[05:18] his son and wife. Together, they will use them 
under the ice to drive the fish toward the net.
[06:07] Fishing under the ice demands strength, patience,
[06:10] and perfect coordination. At the head 
of each team stands a Munkha master,
[06:15] a man who knows the lakes's terrain and its 
secrets. Under his direction, the youngest
[06:20] fisherman stirred the water through the holes, 
guiding the fish toward the center of the net.
[08:19] When it's finally time to pull up the net,
[08:22] everything falls silent. Time seems 
to stop. Everyone holds their breath,
[08:27] wondering if there will be enough fish to feed 
their families through the long winter ahead.
[08:57] Then the first silver fish 
appears followed by hundreds
[09:00] more. A cheer rises across the lake. 
This year has been a great success.
[09:55] Traditionally, Munkha begins in early November 
when the ice is already thick enough to hold
[10:01] thousands of people. But in recent years, because 
of rising temperatures in Siberia, the ice has
[10:06] become thinner and more fragile, making this 
tradition increasingly dangerous. Yet the people
[10:12] continue because Munkha is not just fishing. It's 
their culture, their spirit, their way of life.
[10:24] During the long Arctic winters, the ice grows so 
thick that oxygen can't reach the water. Without
[10:30] it, many fish will suffocate. So, villagers catch 
them before that, gathering food while helping the
[10:36] lake stay in balance. When the catch is finally 
pulled out, the fish are equally shared among
[10:43] all participants and also with neighbors who 
could not take part. To protect nature, they
[10:48] never fish in the same lake for the next 3 years, 
allowing the ecosystem to restore its balance.
[11:14] After a long day, tired but happy, Arian 
and his family are ready to return home.
[13:47] As you already know, Arian loves fried crucian 
carp lovingly prepared by his mother. Life
[13:54] in Yakutia is truly unique, harsh, but 
beautiful. Through Munkha ice fishing,
[13:59] you can see how people here remain united 
with nature and with each other. Even
[14:04] in the coldest inhabited place on Earth, 
life is filled with love, light, and joy.
