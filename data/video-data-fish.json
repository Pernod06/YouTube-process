[cite_start]Among these drifters is the Portuguese Man-of-War, a creature that uses a gas-filled bladder as a sail to navigate the waves and trails tentacles up to 30 meters long armed with lethal stinging cells[cite: 620, 621]. [cite_start]Despite the danger, a small Man-of-War fish makes its home among the tentacles, feeding on the leftovers of the predator's catch while avoiding the stings that paralyze other fish[cite: 621, 622]."

[cite_start]They assemble in piles nearly 100 meters long to molt, shedding their hard shells to grow larger, a process that leaves them soft and vulnerable for days[cite: 623]. [cite_start]Safety in numbers is their primary defense against predators like the massive smooth stingray, which hunts for stragglers or soft, newly molted crabs that become separated from the main group[cite: 624, 625]."

[cite_start]This journey requires them to leap across rock pools where Moray eels and octopuses lie in ambush, ready to crush the crabs' shells[cite: 626, 627]. [cite_start]The crabs must exhibit incredible agility and speed to evade these predators and reach the safety of the grazing pastures before the tide turns and they have to run the gauntlet again[cite: 627]."
