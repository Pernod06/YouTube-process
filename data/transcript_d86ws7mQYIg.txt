How does Computer Hardware Work?  💻🛠🔬  [3D Animated Teardown]
======================================================================

[00:00] Throughout this video we’re going to do
a desktop computer dissection using 3D animation.
[00:06] Kind of like a dissection lab in biology class,
but instead, we’ll journey through the inside
[00:12] of this computer and disassemble every piece
of hardware.  We’ll then use a microscope
[00:18] and zoom in to give you a nanoscopic view
of the transistors and other structures inside.
[00:24] To make this video we disassembled all the
hardware inside a typical desktop computer,
[00:30] we desoldered and removed the components from
each of the printed circuit boards and took
[00:35] thousands of pictures.  Then using these
pictures, we meticulously 3D modeled every
[00:42] single component from the computer case down
to the tiniest resistor.  As a result, here’s
[00:48] all the hardware that we’ll explore throughout
this video.  It kind of looks like a crime
[00:53] scene where someone viciously destroyed a
computer and arranged all the components,
[00:59] but anyways let’s dive right in.  
We’ll begin this journey with the  Central
[01:04] Processing Unit or CPU which is the brain
of the computer.  On top we have the cover,
[01:11] called an integrated heat spreader, and inside
is a smaller metal package that holds the
[01:16] integrated circuit which is technically called
a die. This die is mounted on a printed circuit
[01:23] board that distributes the 1200 connection
points to landing pads that interface with
[01:28] the landing grid array on the motherboard.
The integrated circuit inside has a few different
[01:35] sections, but perhaps the most recognizable
are the 10 cores where programs and instructions
[01:40] are run.  Each core is quite  complicated,
so here’s a diagram laying out the different
[01:46] functional sections.  There are dozens of
rather complicated elements in this diagram,
[01:52] and you can look forward to a series of videos
we’re currently planning which will explore
[01:57] computer architecture and how each of these
sections work.
[02:00] Let’s zoom into a nanoscopic view of the
integrated circuit so we can see individual
[02:06] transistors.  These transistors are incredibly
small, only a few nanometers wide  and in
[02:12] this die there are approximately 8 to 10 billion. 
On top of the transistors are multiple layers
[02:19] of metal wires with vias rising vertically
between the layers.  Together these transistors
[02:26] and wires create a multilayer labyrinth or
highway resulting in a computer that can execute
[02:32] billions of operations every second.  
Let’s now zoom out and look at other sections
[02:38] of the CPU.  To the side of each core is
the shared L3 memory cache and ring interconnect.
[02:45] On the far right is an integrated graphics
processor which functions as a less powerful
[02:50] GPU; in the top left is the memory controller
which sends data to and from the DRAM; and
[02:57] finally on the far left is the system agent
and platform I/O, which communicates with
[03:03] the Chipset on the motherboard and manages
the flow of data between many of the other
[03:08] components in your PC.  So, with that in
mind, let’s move on and look at the motherboard.
[03:14] This motherboard is a massive, printed circuit
board with thousands of wires running inside
[03:20] and a variety of microchips, components,
sockets, ports, slots, headers and connectors
[03:27] soldered to it.  Perhaps the single most
important and expensive component, aside from
[03:32] the bare PCB, is the Chipset, which is this
integrated circuit found underneath a heat
[03:38] sink down here and is connected directly to
the system agent section in the CPU.  Here’s
[03:44] a diagram illustrating how the CPU and chipset
are connected to everything else.  As seen
[03:51] here, the CPU connects directly to the DRAM,
one or two displays, the GPU, and perhaps
[03:58] a few SSDs plugged into the M2 slots.  The
Chipset manages most everything else: data
[04:05] flowing through the ethernet or Wi-Fi, data
going to and from solid state drives and hard
[04:11] drives plugged into the SATA ports, some of
the PCIe slots, your keyboard and mouse, USB
[04:18] devices, and the audio sent to the speakers
or from the microphone.
[04:23] Just a quick note, computer hardware has evolved
immensely over the past 65 years and continues
[04:30] to evolve, so the details we show should be
thought of as a current day example PC and
[04:36] not as how all computers work.
Let’s move on and skip over the many different
[04:41] sockets and connectors throughout the motherboard
and focus on the voltage regulator module
[04:47] or VRM found near the CPU.  These components
are used to drop the voltage coming from the
[04:53] power supply down to the 1.3 volts used by
the CPU.  As a result of all the power flowing
[05:00] through these components and their 80 to 90
percent efficiency,  heat sinks need to be
[05:06] placed on top.
While we’re on the topic of power, this
[05:10] CPU consumes power equivalent to approximately
16 LED bulbs, thus generating a considerable
[05:18] amount of heat which is taken away by the
CPU cooler.  This particular cooler uses
[05:24] a pump to circulate liquid through these tubes
and into the radiator’s channels which transfers
[05:30] heat to the radiator fins.  The fans then
help transfer the heat to the air and the
[05:35] cooled liquid returns to the pump via the
return loop.  The pump is a brushless DC
[05:41] motor constructed from a PCB, a control chip
and a stator on the dry side, a barrier in
[05:48] the middle, and then the permanent magnet
rotor and impeller on the liquid side.  There’s
[05:54] no mechanical connection between the rotor
and stator, thereby preventing any leaks of
[05:59] the cooling liquid. 
Let’s move onto the power supply which distributes
[06:03] power throughout the computer.  In here,
the main transformer reduces the voltage and
[06:09] bridges the isolation boundary between the
primary side high voltage and the secondary
[06:14] side lower voltages used throughout your computer. 
Here’s the control PCB that ensures a stable
[06:21] output voltage and sends adjustment signals
to the switching power transistor on the primary
[06:27] side using opto-isolators.  There are dozens
of other components used to filter the input
[06:33] voltage and generate various output voltages
which are then sent to all the different hardware
[06:39] in your computer.  For example, an SSD consumes
just a few watts, and the connector uses these
[06:46] voltages, whereas your GPU can consume hundreds
of watts using these connectors and these
[06:52] voltages.
Next, we’ll explore the GPU, but before
[06:57] that, let’s take a step back and consider
the technology we’ve covered thus far.
[07:02] Alone, each of these components doesn’t
do much at all, but when united, they combine
[07:07] to form a powerful system.  Similarly, this
video is a multidisciplinary combination of
[07:14] engineering, technology, art and animation
inspired by the Magic School Bus.  We can’t
[07:20] emphasize enough how important it is to be
a multidisciplinary student.  And to help
[07:25] you do that, the sponsor of this video is
Brilliant.org.  Brilliant is a multidisciplinary
[07:31] online education platform which teaches a
ton of different topics in hands-on interactive
[07:37] ways.  Here are two courses from different
disciplines that you might think were entirely
[07:42] unrelated.  However, when combined they provide
the foundational basis for a cutting-edge
[07:47] field of science and engineering.  This combination
of seemingly unrelated courses can be done
[07:53] with pretty much any two courses that Brilliant
offers.

Let’s get back to dissecting this computer
[08:50] and move onto the graphics card and GPU which
is also the brain of the computer… well…
[08:57] actually this analogy doesn’t really work
very well but anyway…  Opening the graphics
[09:02] card we see another PCB, with the GPU’s
integrated circuit in the center, VRAM chips
[09:09] all around, and the voltage regulator module
on the side.  Above the IC is a heat sink
[09:15] with a fan to dissipate heat, and on the side
of the graphics card are HDMI and Display
[09:21] Ports, a PCIe Interface and then on the other
side is the input power connector.
[09:27] Let’s focus on the GPU integrated circuit
which, similar to the CPU, has more than a
[09:33] thousand solder pads that connect it to the
PCB.  Opening the packaging we find the GPU
[09:40] die which is noticeably different from the
CPU.  In here are approximately 11.8 billion
[09:46] transistors organized into 6 graphics processing
clusters, totaling 28 streaming multiprocessors.
[09:55] Each streaming multiprocessor is composed
of 128 cores, resulting in a total of 3,584
[10:03] cores.  Each core has sections for integer
and floating-point arithmetic, and sections
[10:09] for queueing in the operands and collecting
the results and is far simpler than a CPU
[10:15] core.  Additionally, on the die is an L2
memory cache shared among all the graphics
[10:22] processing clusters, a set of memory controllers
that connect to the VRAM located around the
[10:27] processor, and a PCIe interface for connecting
to the CPU.
[10:32] When we zoom in to see a nanoscopic view of
the integrated circuit we find something very
[10:37] similar to what we saw in the CPU, with the
transistors on the bottom and a labyrinth
[10:43] of multiple layers of metal wires above. 
All these structures are manufactured in multibillion
[10:49] dollar semiconductor fabrication plants or
fabs but that’s a topic for a whole different
[10:55] video, so let’s move on.  GPUs and CPUs
are similar in many ways, however, GPUs have
[11:03] thousands of cores that are limited to basic
arithmetic, whereas CPUs have only a handful
[11:09] of cores that perform far more complicated
operations.  Additionally, CPUs have branch
[11:17] prediction and deep pipelines that optimize
the execution of code.    Here’s a quick
[11:22] example of what GPUs can do.  Take this image
comprised of 16 million pixels each with RGB
[11:30] values for each pixel.  A simple way to brighten
the image is to add 20 to each of these numbers.
[11:36] A CPU has 10 cores and thus performs arithmetic
10 numbers at a time whereas GPUs distribute
[11:44] the data to thousands of cores thus performing
magnitudes more parallel processing.
[11:50] Let’s close this graphics card and talk
briefly about the 3D model.  Note that this
[11:55] is a slightly older model graphics card because
we buy most of our hardware as non-functioning
[12:01] parts from eBay, and then, as shown earlier,
we tear them down rather destructively in
[12:08] order to accurately model everything.  Additionally,
sometimes components shown aren’t compatible,
[12:15] such as this motherboard that says DDR4, while
the DRAM is DDR5.
[12:22] That said, modeling and animating everything
to make it feel like you’re actually inside
[12:27] a computer took us around 500 hours and we
would greatly appreciate it if you could take
[12:33] a few seconds to hit that like button, subscribe
if you haven’t already, type up a quick
[12:38] comment below, and share this video with someone
who will enjoy it.  Also, we have a Patreon
[12:44] and would appreciate any support.  We’re
planning more videos on computer architecture
[12:50] and other related topics and can’t do it
without your help, so thank you for doing
[12:55] these 4 quick things. It helps a ton.
Let’s move on and look at the DRAM, Solid
[13:01] State Drives, and Hard Drives.  We’re not
going to spend too long, because we have an
[13:06] entire series of videos on solid state drives,
and then separate videos covering DRAM, and
[13:12] Hard Drives.  But quickly, the CPU communicates
directly with the DRAM through memory channels
[13:18] running inside the motherboard.  Inside each
of these 8 DRAM chips is an integrated circuit
[13:25] composed of 32 memory banks each 8192 columns
wide by 65536 rows tall.  The DRAM temporarily
[13:38] stores data using capacitors and transistors
called 1T1C memory cells in 2D arrays that
[13:45] look like this.  Data can be accessed within
nanoseconds, however, among these 8 chips,
[13:51] only 16 Gigabytes of data can be temporarily
stored.    Take a look at our 35-minute
[13:57] video on DRAM, but for now let’s move on
to SSDs which permanently store data in 3D
[14:05] arrays called 3D NAND.  This array is 100
to 200 layers tall, 32 to 64 thousand columns
[14:13] wide and 32 to 64 thousand rows deep.  Additionally,
within a single SSD chip such as this one,
[14:22] are multiple 3D NAND arrays stacked one on
top of the other.  As a result, a single
[14:28] microchip can store terabytes of data, however
reading or writing data takes 50 or so microseconds,
[14:35] which is 3000 times slower than DRAM.  Zooming
in on a single SSD memory cell we find a charge
[14:43] trap which stores different levels of charge
allowing for 3 bits of data to be more permanently
[14:49] saved.  Looking at the NVMe and SATA SSD,
both have a few 3D NAND data storage chips,
[14:57] a DRAM chip for buffering and holding the
data mapping table and a controller chip.
[15:03] Let’s move on and dissect the hard disk
drive.  Here we have a disk mounted to a
[15:08] spindle with a motor that rotates the disk
at thousands of rpm.  A read write head moves
[15:14] across the disk in order to access a single
track out of half a million other data tracks.
[15:20] Let’s zoom in on the read write head. 
The write head changes the direction of localized
[15:25] magnetic domains in a small layer on the disk
whereas the read head senses these changes
[15:30] in magnetic domains.  This disk drive is
even slower than the SSD, taking a few milliseconds
[15:37] to access, thus resulting in slower read and
write times, but costing less per terabyte
[15:43] of storage.
Thus far we’ve covered all the hardware
[15:46] inside your computer.  So, thanks for watching
this far, and as a bonus here’s what it
[15:52] looks like inside a computer mouse, with the
scroll wheel up top, the infrared light, image
[15:58] sensor, and multiple lenses down here and
the battery and processor in the middle.
[16:04] For computer mice we have separate dedicated
videos exploring the image sensor and scroll
[16:09] wheel with incredible details.
Additionally, here’s what it looks like
[16:14] inside a basic keyboard, with plastic traces
that carry electricity to each key and, when
[16:20] pressed, that key completes a circuit which
is sensed by the processor up here.
[16:26] That’s pretty much it for what it looks
like inside your computer.  We believe the
[16:30] future will require a strong emphasis on engineering
education and we’re thankful to all our
