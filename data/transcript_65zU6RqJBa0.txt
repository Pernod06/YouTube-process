======================================================================

[00:00] Hello everyone, I’m Si Wen.
[00:01] The topic I’m going to talk about in this video is a bit esoteric. One thing
[00:03] we have never mentioned in the video on the eight planets
[00:06] is black holes
[00:07] . On April 10, 2019,
[00:09] humans announced for the first time a picture of 55 million years
[00:12] ago. Photo of a black hole.
[00:13] This black hole is at the center of the Virgo A galaxy M87.
[00:16] It is a supermassive black hole.
[00:18] Its mass is about 6.5 billion times the mass of the sun.
[00:21] Its diameter is about more than 40 billion kilometers.
[00:23] It is about 3.5 times the orbit of Pluto around the sun.
[00:26] Although It was five years ago,
[00:28] but I still remember when I saw this photo,
[00:30] I was thinking,
[00:31] isn't the gravity of a black hole so strong that even light cannot escape?
[00:34] Then why can humans still see it
[00:36] and even take it? How was the photo
[00:38] taken?
[00:39] Let's take a look at this picture
[00:41] first. First, there is the black area in the middle.
[00:43] This is where light cannot escape.
[00:45] There is actually nothing in it.
[00:47] All the matter in the black hole is concentrated in the innermost part
[00:50] called the oddity. This is a point
[00:51] with infinite mass and density
[00:54] but infinitely small volume.
[00:55] In this singularity,
[00:56] our current physics will no longer be applicable
[00:58] . Currently, humans cannot directly observe the singularity.
[01:01] We can only use theory to speculate
[01:03] and then finally Close to the black hole,
[01:04] there is a boundary called the event horizon.
[01:07] Once any material, including light,
[01:08] crosses the event horizon, it is impossible to come out again
[01:11] until it is sucked into the singularity.
[01:12] Therefore, the event horizon is also called the surface of the black hole.
[01:15] The outer circle is the photon of the black hole.
[01:18] When light approaches a black hole,
[01:19] it will be attracted by the strong gravity of the black hole
[01:21] and bend towards the black hole,
[01:23] allowing the light to rotate along the black hole
[01:24] . However, this photon sphere is very unstable and
[01:27] may fall into the black hole at any time,
[01:28] and then the outermost layers of the black hole
[01:30] . The material captured by the black hole's gravity
[01:32] forms a ring-shaped structure like the rings of Saturn around the black hole
[01:35] called an accretion disk.
[01:36] This picture may not be clear.
[01:38] Let's look at another picture.
[01:40] This picture is also of M87 and
[01:42] was taken two years ago. The highly resolved
[01:44] image of a black hole under polarized light
[01:46] released in March 2021.
[01:47] These filaments are the material captured by the gravity of the black hole.
[01:50] And you can see that
[01:52] the black hole is not black. On the
[01:53] contrary,
[01:54] the material in the black hole accretion disk is
[01:55] rotating and rubbing.
[01:57] The temperature will become extremely high
[01:59] and X-rays and electromagnetic radiation will be released outwards.
[02:01] Therefore, the black hole as a whole is very bright in the universe.
[02:04] To take this photo,
[02:06] humans used a
[02:08] telescope with an aperture as large as the earth.
[02:09] Someone said, Si Wen, what you said. No,
[02:11] how can there be a telescope with the same diameter as the earth?
[02:14] Even if there is a telescope, where would you put it?
[02:15] Let me tell you,
[02:16] this telescope is not a single telescope that
[02:19] we usually see
[02:20] , but a combination of eight telescopes from all over the world
[02:23] . The telescopes are combined together
[02:25] to form a network,
[02:26] and this network is a virtual telescope equivalent to the diameter of the Earth.
[02:30] It is called the Event Horizon Telescope,
[02:31] or EHT.
[02:33] It is said that the resolution of this telescope
[02:34] is so high.
[02:35] You can clearly see
[02:38] one in Los Angeles in New York. The date on the coin
[02:39] . It is precisely because of this amazing resolution
[02:41] that the EHT was able to observe the black hole in M87
[02:44] and not only capture the appearance of the black hole.
[02:46] The size of the halo in the photo
[02:50] is almost the same
[02:51] as predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity. Many scientists say
[02:53] that black holes are the last piece of the puzzle in Einstein's general theory of relativity.
[03:01] In November 1783,
[03:02] the British natural scientist John Mitchell
[03:04] wrote a letter
[03:07] to Cavendish, a very famous scientist at the time.
[03:08] In the letter, he said
[03:10] that light is also Affected by universal gravitation
[03:11] , and he used the law of universal gravitation
[03:13] to calculate a kind of celestial body.
[03:14] This celestial body has a very large mass
[03:16] , and its gravity is so
[03:17] great that even light cannot escape.
[03:19] As a result, this kind of celestial body looks completely black from the outside,
[03:22] so humans can also see it in the universe. It wasn't
[03:24] until Michelle called this kind of celestial body
[03:26] a dark star
[03:26] that it was the earliest understanding of black holes by humans.
[03:29] In order to understand the dark star Michelle talked about,
[03:31] let's first talk about a concept
[03:32] : gravity.
[03:33] We all know that on the earth,
[03:35] we move towards the sky. If you throw a ball,
[03:36] the ball
[03:38] will eventually fall back into our hands
[03:39] because our strength and speed are not enough.
[03:41] If the ball you throw
[03:43] can reach the first cosmic speed,
[03:44] which is 7.9 kilometers per second
[03:46] , then the ball can go around
[03:48] If you have more power
[03:50] and can make this ball reach the second cosmic speed
[03:53] , which is 11.2 kilometers per second
[03:55] , which is the escape velocity of the earth,
[03:56] then it can fly out of the control of the earth's gravity like a rocket.
[03:59] According to Michelle Calculate that
[04:01] when the mass of a star is equivalent to 500 suns
[04:04] , the escape velocity of the star
[04:06] will exceed the speed of light
[04:07] , which is 300,000 kilometers per second.
[04:09] At this time,
[04:10] even light will become a ball thrown towards us
[04:12] forever. There is no way to escape
[04:14] , but think about it,
[04:15] can the speed of light be surpassed?
[04:17] Not to mention that in 1783,
[04:18] even in our current understanding,
[04:20] the speed of light could not be surpassed.
[04:21] So Michelle was a very powerful person.
[04:23] His thinking at the time was too advanced
[04:25] , so he was considered
[04:27] One of the greatest unknown scientists in history.
[04:29] Why is he called an unknown scientist?
[04:31] It’s because he is too low-key
[04:32] , so the world only knows Cavendish
[04:35] and has almost forgotten John Michell.
[04:37] But it is also because the concept of dark stars he proposed is too He was so ahead of
[04:40] his time that when he was reading out his paper,
[04:42] no one in the audience reacted at all
[04:44] , not even those who objected.
[04:46] In the next 100 years or so,
[04:48] no one mentioned the concept of dark stars anymore,
[04:54] although gravity was proposed by Newton.
[04:56] But what exactly is gravity
[04:57] and how is it produced?
[04:59] Newton did not give an answer until
[05:00] Einstein published his general theory of relativity
[05:02] in December 1915,
[05:04] which described gravity as a distortion of space for the first time.
[05:07] Any object with mass will deform space-time,
[05:09] and gravity is actually just space. What does the distorted external appearance
[05:12] mean?
[05:13] Let me give you an example.
[05:14] If you put a sphere with a certain mass on a plane
[05:17] like this
[05:18] , then everyone will see that the plane will sink.
[05:21] Einstein said
[05:22] that this is gravity
[05:22] , but this is just gravity. If a two-dimensional plane
[05:24] is in a three-dimensional space,
[05:26] then the sphere will be distorted all around.
[05:28] This is what Einstein said. Universal
[05:30] gravity is the distortion of space.
[05:31] But when the general theory of relativity was first proposed,
[05:34] almost everyone did not understand it and did not understand it. I believe that
[05:36] there is only one person who understood Einstein’s theory
[05:38] and that was Karl Schwarzschild.
[05:40] But Karl Schwarzschild was not present
[05:41] when Einstein lectured
[05:43] because it was during the First World War.
[05:46] Karl Schwarzschild was The person who was responsible for calculating the trajectory of artillery shells at the front
[05:49] received Einstein's paper on general relativity
[05:50] a month after the paper was published.
[05:53] Then he wrote a letter to Einstein.
[05:55] He said that
[05:56] despite the continuous artillery fire
[05:57] , the war was still very kind to me
[05:59] . You can get away from it all
[06:01] and take a stroll in the land of your thoughts.
[06:03] When Einstein saw this letter,
[06:04] he was completely stunned.
[06:06] Because the letter also
[06:08] contains an exact solution to the field equation
[06:10] of general relativity. The nonlinear field equation in Einstein's paper
[06:12] is very difficult to solve.
[06:13] Even Einstein himself,
[06:15] as the proposer of the theory, only gave an approximation
[06:18] , and Karl It can be said to be a miracle that
[06:20] Schwarzschild calculated the exact value
[06:22] in just a few days
[06:23] on a battlefield filled with
[06:24] explosions and poison gas.
[06:26] Schwarzschild’s calculations predict
[06:28] that when a supermassive star collapses after death,
[06:31] There will be an area around it
[06:33] from which nothing,
[06:34] whether light or
[06:35] dust,
[06:36] can escape.
[06:37] This area is like opening a bottomless hole in the universe.
[06:40] Light and matter can enter
[06:41] but can never come out again,
[06:43] so they will eventually be squeezed. Entering a singular point where the density and mass are infinite
[06:46] but the volume is infinitesimal,
[06:48] that is, a singularity.
[06:49] Einstein did not believe
[06:51] Schwarzschild’s calculation results
[06:53] and said, could such a thing really exist in a universe
[06:55] with infinite mass and infinitesimal volume ?
[06:58] In fact, It wasn’t just Einstein who didn’t believe it.
[06:59] The mainstream scientific community at the time didn’t believe it.
[07:02] The British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington
[07:04] directly stated in his book that
[07:06] the singularity mentioned by Schwarzschild does not exist.
[07:08] A star does not exist at all. It may collapse into a point
[07:11] because the atoms are crushed
[07:12] in such a state,
[07:14] but I don’t believe it.
[07:15] Einstein still approves
[07:17] of Schwarzschild’s calculation method ,
[07:19] but he can’t find the singularity that Schwarzschild said,
[07:21] so Einstein finally believed
[07:22] that his general theory of relativity must not be perfect enough
[07:25] for Schwarzschild to calculate such outrageous results.
[07:28] However, Schwarzschild did not hear these doubts because he actually wrote
[07:31] to Einstein on the day he wrote the letter.
[07:33] He already suffered from an incurable skin disease and
[07:35] was covered in blisters.
[07:37] Doctors said it might have been caused by poisonous gas on the battlefield.
[07:39] He died
[07:41] just over two months later
[07:42] at the age of 42.
[07:46] After Schwarzschild's death,
[07:47] this theory was slow. It was slowly forgotten by people
[07:50] until more than ten years later,
[07:51] in 1930, there was an Indian-American physicist named Chandrasekhar.
[07:55] He was Eddington’s student
[07:56] and Yang Zhenning’s doctoral supervisor.
[07:59] When he was 73 years old,
[08:00] He won the Nobel Prize in Physics
[08:03] for proposing the Chandrasekhar limit,
[08:04] but this theory was proposed when he was 20 years old.
[08:07] After graduating from college in 1930,
[08:09] Chandrasekhar decided to continue his studies at Cambridge University
[08:12] . It takes 18 days to take a boat from India to England.
[08:15] Chandrasekhar felt bored on the boat
[08:17] and began to study the evolution of stars.
[08:19] What will happen to stars after they die?
[08:21] The mainstream view in the scientific community is
[08:23] that stars will die after their energy is exhausted. Due to
[08:25] its own gravity, it begins to collapse
[08:27] and eventually its volume will shrink to about the same size as the Earth.
[08:29] At this time, its density will become very high
[08:32] and it will emit weak white light
[08:34] and become a white dwarf.
[08:35] To put it bluntly,
[08:36] they thought that the white dwarf was
[08:38] the final result of the death of a star. status,
[08:40] but after repeated calculations, Chandrasekhar found that
[08:42] not all stars will eventually become white dwarfs,
[08:45] but have a certain mass limit.
[08:47] If the mass of the remaining core
[08:49] of a star after exhausting its energy
[08:51] exceeds 1.44 times the mass of the sun,
[08:53] then the white dwarf star will It is no longer the final destination.
[08:55] In this case,
[08:56] the collapse caused by gravity will continue
[08:58] and become more violent
[08:59] , eventually leading to the destruction of the atomic structure
[09:02] to form a neutron star.
[09:03] This 1.44 times is called the Chandrasekhar limit
[09:06] , and a neutron star is more powerful than a white dwarf. It is much smaller,
[09:08] with a diameter of only about 20 kilometers,
[09:10] and the density is astonishingly
[09:11] high.
[09:12] The spoon we usually use
[09:14] has a mass of 1 billion tons
[09:16] , and it rotates extremely fast,
[09:18] so neutron stars are also called pulsars
[09:20] . If the mass of the star's remaining core
[09:23] exceeds 3.2 times the mass of the sun,
[09:25] the neutron star will collapse under its own gravity.
[09:27] There will be no force in the universe to block this collapse,
[09:30] and it will inevitably collapse into a black hole.
[09:32] But at that time, people were very concerned about neutron stars.
[09:35] It can be said that he knows nothing
[09:36] about black holes , so when Chandrasekhar
[09:38] finished reading his paper
[09:40] in 1935 , he was wildly ridiculed and criticized
[09:43] by the mainstream scientific community. The person who suppressed him the most
[09:45] was his mentor Eddington
[09:46] . The physicist Eddington we just talked about who opposed the Schwarzschild
[09:49] singularity disparaged Chandrasekhar's corollary in front of everyone
[09:53] and even tore up his paper
[09:55] because Eddington was at that time He is a very prestigious person in the scientific community,
[09:58] so no one supported Chandrasekhar.
[10:00] They also did not understand Chandrasekhar's inferences and calculations.
[10:03] Moreover, it was during the Second World War that
[10:05] the war caused many physics problems. Everyone has shifted their research goals
[10:08] to military technology, and
[10:09] they no longer even study general relativity.
[10:11] Therefore, no one cares about whether stars collapse or not
[10:13] . Everyone can think about
[10:15] the impact of this experience
[10:16] on a young man in his 20s.
[10:18] How much damage was done to
[10:19] Chandrasekhar's psychology
[10:21] ? He later gave up research in this area
[10:23] and left the UK in 1937.
[10:25] Einstein himself also said
[10:27] that those who studied general relativity were
[10:29] not only questioned but also despised
[10:30] at the time.
[10:31] Many people thought they were crazy
[10:33] , and this view did not change until Einstein's death.
[10:39] Until the advent of computers
[10:41] in the mid-1950s.
[10:43] In 1964, John Wheeler used the most advanced computers at the time
[10:46] to successfully simulate the approaching of massive stars.
[10:49] The process of inward collapse at death.
[10:50] He discovered that if a star is massive enough,
[10:53] there is no force in the entire universe that can
[10:56] block the gravity-induced collapse.
[10:57] Eventually, a singularity will be formed
[10:59] in which
[11:00] physics will no longer apply
[11:02] . Past, present, and The future will be chaotic.
[11:05] This is completely beyond my cognition.
[11:07] But I don’t understand it. It’s not important.
[11:08] What’s important is that this is exactly the same as Schwarzschild and Chandrasekhar’s
[11:11] predictions.
[11:12] Wheeler was also different originally. He believed in the singularity
[11:14] and studied the
[11:16] theory of relativity just to overturn the starting point.
[11:18] But he did not expect that he would eventually become a supporter of the singularity
[11:21] , and he discovered that there is a boundary closest to the black hole,
[11:24] which is the event horizon we just talked about
[11:26] . If you cross the event horizon, it is impossible to come back.
[11:29] Unless you escape faster than the speed of light,
[11:31] then you can escape.
[11:32] But everyone knows that this is impossible
[11:34] , so once you cross the event horizon, you will keep falling.
[11:37] If we enter the event horizon,
[11:38] we are feet. When we rush down,
[11:39] the pulling force on our feet will
[11:41] be much greater than the pulling force on the head,
[11:43] so our body will be stretched
[11:45] like noodles
[11:46] , but this is just a theory.
[11:47] Although the human body has a certain degree of toughness
[11:49] , under this kind of gravity,
[11:50] I feel The cells have already been torn apart
[11:52] before they are elongated
[11:53] , and there is a rather magical phenomenon.
[11:55] If you observe from the earth at this time,
[11:57] you will see that the person stops at the moment he enters the event horizon
[12:01] and does not fall into
[12:02] the body. It was not stretched
[12:03] but stopped there.
[12:04] According to the general theory of relativity,
[12:08] the time around the event horizon flows very slowly.
[12:11] So from the earth,
[12:12] the moment people enter the event world, they stop there.
[12:15] However, people themselves see that they are still falling
[12:18] until they enter the singularity.
[12:19] On the other hand,
[12:20] when we look at the event horizon from the outside, time is slow,
[12:22] but when you look at the event horizon from the outside, Looking at the outer universe is like fast forwarding,
[12:26] so theoretically
[12:27] you can see the moment when the universe ends at the event horizon. In
[12:31] 1967,
[12:32] Wheeler officially used the term black hole in his speech.
[12:35] Everyone felt that this term was too vivid
[12:38] because It is like the Bermuda Triangle in the universe.
[12:40] No matter what falls in, it will never come out.
[12:42] However, although the results of computer analogies
[12:44] have made more and more people believe in the existence of black holes
[12:47] , whenever there is support, there will be opposition.
[12:49] As the saying goes, seeing with the eyes To be honest,
[12:51] no one has ever seen a black hole
[12:53] in Neptune. At least after calculation, we can use telescopes to observe it
[12:56] . But what about black holes?
[12:57] You told me that there is a black hole.
[12:58] Who has seen it ?
[12:59] So scientists began to think about
[13:01] how to find invisible black holes.
[13:06] Until 1971 The 28 -
[13:07] year-old astronomer Thomas Bolton announced that
[13:11] he had found a black hole
[13:12] . How did Bolton find the black hole?
[13:14] This brings up a satellite.
[13:15] In December 1970,
[13:17] NASA launched the first X-ray astronomy satellite in human history
[13:20] called the Uhuru satellite.
[13:22] How is this satellite different
[13:24] from other satellites and detectors launched by humans
[13:26] ? The most important thing is that
[13:27] it does not use a camera to take pictures,
[13:29] but collects X-rays
[13:31] , converts them into images and sounds,
[13:33] and then studies
[13:34] X-rays. Everyone knows the essence of X-rays. It’s a kind of light
[13:37] , so we sometimes call it X-ray.
[13:39] But we can’t see this kind of light.
[13:41] The CT and chest X-rays we go to the hospital to take,
[13:44] or the security checks in subways and airports all use X-rays.
[13:47] In fact, they are everywhere in the universe. X-rays
[13:49] The sun is also constantly emitting a large amount of X-rays.
[13:52] The mission of Uhuru is to collect
[13:54] various X-rays in the universe
[13:56] and then transmit them back to humans for research.
[13:58] Among the 339 X-ray sources he discovered,
[14:00] there is one ray. The source was very strange.
[14:02] The number of this ray source was Cygnus X-1
[14:05] .
Its X-ray intensity fluctuated several times per second.
[14:09] So Bolton began to observe Cygnus X-1 with a telescope.
[14:12] Soon he was at Cygnus X-1. It was discovered that a blue supergiant
[14:16] mass is about 20 to 40 times the mass of the sun.
[14:19] But the strange thing is
[14:20] that the X-rays are not emitted from it
[14:23] but near it,
[14:24] and the trajectory of this blue giant star is also very special
[14:26] . It's like orbiting a
[14:28] massive companion star that is invisible
[14:30] but can emit powerful X-rays.
[14:32] It feels like Pluto and Charon.
[14:34] After two months of observation and calculations,
[14:36] Bolton found that the mass of this invisible companion star
[14:39] turned out to be It is more than 15 times as
[14:41] massive as the sun, invisible
[14:42] and can emit powerful X-rays.
[14:44] Isn't this a black hole?
[14:45] So although it was not completely confirmed
[14:47] , Bolton still bet on his career.
[14:50] Soon he announced
[14:51] Cygnus X-1 to the outside world. It is a black hole
[14:53] , and he also said that this blue superstar is being
[14:56] swallowed by the black hole next to it
[14:58] . After the results were announced,
[14:59] more and more scientists began to pay attention to Cygnus X-1.
[15:03] Among them was a physicist
[15:04] named Stephen Hawking .
[15:06] I believe everyone is familiar with
[15:07] his book "A Brief History of Time".
[15:09] Many people may have bought it,
[15:10] but everyone has read a few pages.
[15:12] Has anyone finished it?
[15:13] You can leave a message and tell me
[15:14] that Hawking was studying the radiation of black holes
[15:17] because of that At that time, most people thought
[15:19] that black holes were like Pixiu, which
[15:20] could only be entered and not exited
[15:21] . But imagine a situation like this.
[15:23] If there is a cup of hot water
[15:24] and you throw it into the black hole,
[15:26] would all the information about the cup of hot water disappear?
[15:29] But this cup of hot water has entropy.
[15:32] Everyone knows
[15:33] that entropy never decreases in the universe.
[15:36] After this cup of water enters a black hole,
[15:37] the entropy of the hot water will inevitably disappear from the universe.
[15:40] If black holes have no entropy,
[15:41] then Doesn’t the entropy in the universe decrease?
[15:43] This violates the second law of thermodynamics.
[15:46] So at that time, there was an Israeli physicist named Bekenstein
[15:49] who boldly proposed
[15:51] that the entropy of a black hole is its surface area.
[15:54] Both of these things are increasing forever. The unabated
[15:56] Hawking initially opposed Bekenstein's conclusion
[15:59] because there is no existence of heat in general relativity.
[16:01] How can it be related to thermodynamics?
[16:03] And if the black hole has entropy
[16:05] , then the black hole will have temperature
[16:06] . If there is temperature, there will be thermal radiation.
[16:08] If there is thermal radiation, there will definitely be particles emitted outwards.
[16:11] However, general relativity has proven that
[16:12] a black hole is a celestial body that can only go in and out.
[16:14] How can it be possible for particles to be emitted outwards from the inside?
[16:17] Later, Hawking used quantum mechanics to study black holes and discovered
[16:21] that black holes are really The surface area of ​​thermal radiation
[16:23] is indeed entropy
[16:24] , which also proves that Bekenstein's conclusion is correct
[16:27] . We now call this phenomenon Hawking radiation. On
[16:35] September 14, 2015,
[16:36] the Gravitational Wave Observatory in Louisiana, USA,
[16:39] detected the sound of a black hole
[16:52] . The sound was very short,
[16:54] lasting even a second
[16:55] , but it also made the observatory staff very excited.
[16:57] However, the observatory did not announce this discovery.
[17:00] They were worried that it was a false signal
[17:02] because the observatory had
[17:04] such an own incident
[17:05] before . In 2014,
[17:06] they announced that they had discovered
[17:09] the original gravitational waves generated
[17:10] during the Big Bang , but it was later verified that
[17:12] what they detected was only a false signal caused by interstellar dust
[17:15] , so they were particularly cautious this time.
[17:17] After several months of verification and research
[17:19] until February 11, 2016
[17:21] They just announced this discovery.
[17:22] This is the gravitational wave produced when two black holes merge.
[17:25] One black hole has a mass of about 36 times that of the sun.
[17:27] The other black hole has a mass of about 29 times of the sun.
[17:30] The two black holes gradually get closer to each other
[17:33] under the influence of gravity . The energy released during the merger
[17:35] is equivalent to the energy produced by the simultaneous explosion of countless nuclear bombs.
[17:38] This energy spreads outward in the form of gravitational waves and traveled
[17:40] 1.3 billion light-years before reaching the earth.
[17:43] Some people may have questions about
[17:44] such a powerful gravitational wave
[17:46] waiting for it to reach the earth. Wouldn’t that
[17:47] be the end of humanity?
[17:49] In fact, you don’t have to worry.
[17:51] If the earth is near these two black holes
[17:53] , we will indeed not survive.
[17:55] But this time the gravitational waves were generated when the two black holes merged 1.3 billion years ago.
[17:59] 1.3 billion years ago,
[18:00] after 1.3 billion years of attenuation,
[18:02] it was already very weak when it reached the earth.
[18:05] It is not as strong as the feeling when the wind blows through the hair,
[18:08] so it is not felt by us at all.
[18:15] After so many years of research,
[18:16] humans have finally There is evidence of the existence of black holes
[18:19] , but some people still say that only pictures can tell the truth.
[18:21] If you can take a picture of a black hole
[18:23] , then you have truly found a black hole.
[18:25] But if you want to take a picture of a black hole, you have to think about two questions
[18:28] : 1. How to take a picture
[18:29] ; 2. Which one to take
[18:30] first ? The first point is how to take pictures.
[18:31] Traditional optical telescopes can only capture visible light,
[18:34] but black holes are invisible.
[18:36] Therefore, you cannot use optical telescopes to take pictures of black holes. You must
[18:38] use radio telescopes.
[18:40] Radio telescopes can capture a lot of
[18:42] light that is invisible to the naked eye,
[18:43] such as the large amount of radiation emitted by black holes.
[18:44] It can be easily captured with a radio telescope
[18:47] , but one radio telescope is not enough to
[18:49] capture the entire picture of a black hole.
[18:50] It is necessary to find a way to make the diameter of the telescope bigger, the better.
[18:53] So scientists from all over the world have joined forces to create a virtual telescope network
[18:57] called the event horizon. The abbreviation of the telescope,
[18:58] EHT, is the one we mentioned at the beginning.
[19:01] This virtual telescope is composed of eight radio telescopes
[19:04] in the north, from Spain
[19:05] to the south, and in Antarctica.
[19:07] These eight telescopes cooperate with each other
[19:08] to observe the same target
[19:10] and record data.
[19:11] Therefore, the classification of this virtual telescope The resolution is
[19:13] equivalent to that of a radio telescope with the diameter of the earth.
[19:17] How to take a good picture?
[19:18] The second problem is to take a picture.
[19:20] There are many black holes in the universe
[19:22] and they are far away from the earth
[19:23] , so be sure to choose a good shooting target.
[19:25] The closer and bigger the target, the bigger
[19:26] it must be taken. The better the effect.
[19:28] In the end, scientists have locked on two targets.
[19:30] One is the black hole Sagittarius A* in the center of the Milky Way.
[19:33] This may be the largest black hole
[19:34] closest to the earth.
[19:36] Its mass is about 4.3 million times that of the sun.
[19:38] The other is
[19:39] quite large. The center of the Virgo A galaxy
[19:41] M87
[19:43] is the black hole we mentioned at the beginning. Its
[19:44] mass is 6.5 billion times that of the sun. It is 55
[19:46] million light years away from the earth.
[19:48] After about two years,
[19:50] on April 10, 2019,
[19:51] humans finally obtained the first photo of a black hole
[19:54] . We have already introduced
[19:56] the imaging principle of the photo.
[19:58] It is actually the same as the imaging principle
[20:00] of the MRI in the hospital. So you can say that it is a computer-generated image.
[20:02] On May 12, 2022,
[20:04] humans took the second photo of a black hole
[20:06] . Photo of Sagittarius A*,
[20:08] the black hole at the center of our Milky Way.
[20:10] This black hole is
[20:11] more than 1,000 times smaller than M87,
[20:13] and its mass is much smaller
[20:14] . As a black hole in the Milky Way,
[20:16] some people worry that we will be swallowed by this black hole.
[20:19] In fact, there is no need to worry at all.
[20:20] The Earth is very far away from the center of the Milky Way.
[20:22] You don’t have to worry about being swallowed up.
[20:24] Even if one day
[20:26] humans may no longer be around,
[20:27] the last picture of the black hole released in 2024
[20:30] is this one
[20:31] . It was taken in April 2018 and
[20:33] has been analyzed for six years
[20:35] . 2024 It was only officially announced
[20:37] this year that
[20:40] she photographed the M87 black hole in the Virgo A galaxy.
[20:41] It seems that the two photos are the same.
[20:43] Although there is indeed a difference in the brightness and shape of the halo if you look closely
[20:46] , there is basically no big difference.
[20:48] In fact, there is no difference at all. The good
[20:50] results of these two observations show that
[20:52] the mass of the black hole and the size of the halo are the same,
[20:55] indicating that the black hole
[20:57] has not changed significantly in
[20:58] this year . This is the same
[21:00] as the prediction of the size of the black hole by Einstein's general theory of relativity.
[21:02] It is a black hole. The diameter depends on its mass.
[21:04] As long as the mass of the black hole does not increase significantly
[21:07] , the width of M87 should remain unchanged.
[21:09] However, judging from the current accretion speed of M87,
[21:12] its radius will not change again
[21:13] in the history of mankind
[21:15] . If there are other advanced civilizations in the future,
[21:18] we may be able to see its changes
[21:22] . The reason why humans like to study black holes so much
[21:24] is not only because black holes themselves are mysterious,
[21:26] but also related to the birth of the universe
[21:28] . According to the Big Bang theory,
[21:30] the birth of the universe originated from a miracle. There
[21:32] happens
[21:35] to be a singularity in a black hole. Isn't it the best research object to find the origin of the universe?
[21:37] So far,
[21:39] although humans have heard the sound of black holes
[21:40] and taken photos of black holes
[21:42] , their understanding of black holes is far from enough
[21:44] . What is its ultimate fate
[21:46] ? Will it disintegrate
[21:47] ? What is inside a black hole?
[21:49] Is it a wormhole or a white hole?
[21:50] So in order to solve these problems,
[21:52] scientists are also envisioning
[21:53] and hoping that one day they can launch radio telescopes into space
[21:56] because the size of the earth is limited
[21:58] no matter how large the aperture is.
[21:59] At most, it is a telescope as big as the EHT.
[22:02] It cannot be bigger.
[22:03] But if you can launch a radio telescope into space, it will be different.
[22:06] You can form a telescope with a larger diameter.
[22:08] Then you can observe more black holes
[22:11] and even the secrets of the entire universe
[23:03] .
